The market participants can bid in the switch auction through the Switch Transaction module provided in the e-Kuber portal.Bidding in a switch transaction2. Bidding in the auction implies that the market participants agree to sell the source security/ies to the Government of India (GoI) and simultaneously agree to buy the destination security from the GoI at their respective quoted prices.Placing of bids3. Each bid should specify the following details:Amount of the source security (Face Value) that the participants are willing to sell.Price of the source security (expressed up to two decimal places).Choice of destination security and the price of the destination security (expressed up to two decimal places), at which the participants are willing to buy the destination security.4. The participants can choose to bid for any/all the destination security/ies, but the aggregate amount of bids for the source security should not exceed their holdings of the source security in face value terms.Minimum Bid size5. Minimum bid size would be ?10,000 and in multiples of ?10,000 thereafter. The participants are allowed to submit multiple bids. However, the aggregate amount of bids submitted should not exceed the notified amount of source security/basket of source securities in the auction.Price of source security6. The price of the source security quoted must be equal to the FBIL closing price of the source security as on the previous working day.7. Bids for source security not as per the price mentioned above will be rejected.Price of destination security8. Bids for the destination security may be placed after taking into account the price of source security as mentioned above.Method of auction9. The auction will be a multiple-price based auction, i.e. successful bids will get accepted at their respective quoted prices for the source and destination securities.Auction decision10. The auction cut-off will be decided based on the price of the destination security/ies.11. Successful bidders are those who have placed their bids at or above the cut-off price. All bids lower than the cut-off price will be rejected.12. There will be provision of pro-rata allotment, should there be more than one successful bid at the cut-off price.Amount of destination security and dealing in odd amounts during switch auction13. The switch ratio, which is the ratio of the price of the source security to the price of the destination security, would be rounded off at 8 decimal places.14. The amount of destination security to be issued for each successful bid will be computed by multiplying the allotted amount (FV) of the source security with the rounded-off switch ratio. The amount of destination security (FV) would be rounded-off to the nearest lower value in multiples of ?10,000.15. The odd amount of destination securities (less than ?10,000) which has been rounded-off, would be notionally allotted and bought back from the bidders at the quoted bid price of the destination security. The net cash consideration to be paid to the bidder for such odd amounts would be the clean price of these securities (as the accrued interest received during notional allotment and paid during notional buyback offset each other).Fund settlement16. Though the conversion would be broadly cash neutral, there will be fund settlement for the net accrued interest (accrued interest for the source security FV ? accrued interest for the destination security FV) for each bid. Cash consideration (due to rounding-off of face value of destination security) computed for each bid would be added to the net accrued interest. Accordingly, fund settlement will be done for the final amount (Net accrued interest + cash consideration) for each bid.Note: An illustration for the calculation of cash consideration due to rounding-off of destination security face value is as given below:17. The settlement of the auction would be held on T+1 basis.Help Desk18.

RBI Bulletin ? June 2024,https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=58121,"Today, the Reserve Bank released the June 2024 issue of its monthly Bulletin. The Bulletin includes three speeches, three articles, and current statistics.The three articles are: I. State of the Economy; II. Financial Stocks and Flow of Funds of the Indian Economy 2021-22; and III. India's Deposit Insurance @60: Retrospect and Prospect.I. State of the EconomyGlobal growth was resilient in the first quarter of 2024. Many central banks have pivoted towards a less restrictive monetary policy stance in response to the fall in inflation in their economies. In India, high-frequency indicators suggest the real GDP growth in Q1:2024-25 is broadly maintaining the pace it achieved in the preceding quarter. The prospects for agriculture are brightening with the early landfall of the southwest monsoon. Headline inflation is gradually easing, driven by sustained softening of its core component, although the path of disinflation is interrupted by volatile and elevated food prices.II. Financial Stocks and Flow of Funds of the Indian Economy 2021-22by Suraj S, Ishu Thakur and Mousumi PriyadarshiniThis article presents underlying trends in the financial stocks and flows (FSF) during 2021-22 across the institutional sectors of the Indian economy. The analysis of financial flows provides insights into interconnections across sectors by mapping the sources and uses of funds. The non-consolidated detailed statements, based on the annual compilation cycle, are also being released with the article.Highlights:The sectoral analysis of financial stocks and flows (FSF) during 2021-22 indicates that households and financial corporations remained the surplus sectors accommodating the deficit of the general government and private non-financial corporations. With recovery in domestic demand, the economy returned to the net borrower status (mirroring current account deficit) in 2021-22, majorly on account of reduction in net resource flows from other depository corporations (ODCs) and other financial corporations (OFCs) and lower funding from households and private non-financial corporations.As uses of funds outweighed sources across sectors, net financial wealth of the domestic sector moderated to 29.8 percent of GDP at end-March 2022 relative to the previous year; however, it was well above the pre-pandemic position (23.8 per cent in 2019-20).         The net financial wealth (NFW) of households at 93.5 per cent of GDP as at end-March 2022, although lower than the preceding year, exceeded the pre-pandemic NFW of 82.8 per cent in 2019-20.III. India?s Deposit Insurance @60: Retrospect and Prospectby Ashutosh Yashwant Raravikar, Avijit Joarder, Anup KumarThis article delineates the path travelled by India?s deposit insurance system, spells out its achievements and suggests an agenda for its onward journey.Highlights:The spread and coverage of deposit insurance has gradually expanded across the world especially since the global financial crisis.Established with the objectives of financial stability and protection of small depositors, India?s deposit insurance system has reached a milestone with completion of sixty years of its existence. Its major achievements include enhanced coverage limit, speedy settlement of claims, revisions in premium, robust deposit insurance fund, prudent treasury management and initiatives for depositor awareness.Empirical estimates indicate that the Reserve Ratio1 is expected to increase steadily in the near future.The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not represent the views of the Reserve Bank of India.(Puneet Pancholy)           Chief General ManagerPress Release: 2024-2025/5241 Reserve Ratio is defined as the ratio of Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) to Insured Deposits (ID).",19/06/2024,"The Reserve Bank released its June 2024 Bulletin featuring three speeches, three articles, and current statistics.
