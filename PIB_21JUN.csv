As a part of the agreement, IIIT Delhi will conduct surveys for collecting imagery and other related data related to availability and condition of road signages on selected National Highways stretches. The tentative length to be covered under this project shall be around 25,000 km. The data collected through surveys will be processed by IIIT Delhi through deployment of Artificial Intelligence for accurate identification and classification of road signs. The survey report based on the results will include geo- stamped inventory of existing road signs with the categorisation, broad structural condition of the road signs and other ancillary data. The institute will also conduct gap study that will be carried out by assessing the difference between the survey findings and the requirement of road signs as per the approved road signages plan of the respective Contract Agreement. The gap study shall additionally cover the requirements as per latest Codal Provisions relevant to high- speed corridors to cater the enhanced safety requirements.
