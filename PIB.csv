INDIA’S REAL GDP PROJECTED TO GROW BETWEEN 6.5–7 PER CENT IN 2024-25,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034973,"India’s real GDP is projected to grow between 6.5–7 per cent in 2024-25. The Indian economy recovered swiftly from the pandemic, with its real GDP in FY24 being 20 per cent higher than the pre-COVID, FY20 levels. This was stated by the Economic Survey 2023-24 presented in Parliament today by the Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt Nirmala Sitharaman.The Survey points out that the domestic growth drivers have supported economic growth in FY24 despite uncertain global economic performance. It also adds that during the decade ending FY20, India grew at an average annual rate of 6.6 per cent, more or less reflecting the long-run growth prospects of the economy. The Survey, however cautions that any escalation of geopolitical conflicts in 2024 may lead to supply dislocations, higher commodity prices, reviving inflationary pressures and stalling monetary policy easing with potential repercussions for capital flows. This can also influence RBI’s monetary policy stance. The global trade outlook for 2024 remains positive, with merchandise trade expected to pick up after registering a contraction in volumes in 2023. The Survey highlights that leveraging the initiatives taken by the government and capturing the untapped potential in emerging markets; exports of business, consultancy and IT-enabled services can expand. Despite the core inflation rate being around 3 per cent, the RBI, with one eye on the withdrawal of accommodation and another on the US Fed, has kept interest rates unchanged for quite some time, and the anticipated easing has been delayed.The Survey highlights that on the external front, moderation in merchandise exports continued during FY24, mainly on account of weaker global demand and persistent geopolitical tensions. Despite that India's service exports have remained robust, reaching a new high of USD 341.1 billion in FY24. The exports (merchandise and services) in FY24 grew by 0.15 per cent, while the total imports declined by 4.9 per cent stated the survey.Net private transfers, mostly comprising remittances from abroad, grew to USD 106.6 billion in FY24. As a result, the Current Account Deficit (CAD) stood at 0.7 per cent of the GDP during the year, an improvement from the deficit of 2.0 per cent of GDP in FY23. The net FPI inflows stood at USD 44.1 billion during FY24 against net outflows in the preceding two years. Overall, India’s external sector is being deftly managed with comfortable foreign exchange reserves and a stable exchange rate. Forex reserves as of the end of March 2024 were sufficient to cover 11 months of projected imports.The Survey underscores that the Indian Rupee has also been one of the least volatile currencies among its emerging market peers in FY24. India’s external debt vulnerability indicators also continued to be benign. External debt as a ratio to GDP stood at a low level of 18.7 per cent as of end-March 2024. The ratio of foreign exchange reserves to total debt stood at 97.4 per cent as of March 2024 as per the Economic Survey 2023- 24.The Survey points out that India’s social welfare approach has undergone a shift from an input-based approach to outcome-based empowerment. Government initiatives like providing free-of-cost gas connections under PM Ujjwala Yojana, building toilets under the Swacch Bharat Mission, opening bank accounts under Jan Dhan Yojana, building pucca houses under PM-AWAS Yojana have improved capabilities and enhanced opportunities for the underprivileged sections. The approach also involves the targeted implementation of reforms for last-mile service delivery to truly realise the maxim of “no person left behind”, the Survey added. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme and Jan Dhan Yojana-Aadhaar-Mobile trinity have been boosters of fiscal efficiency and minimization of leakages, with ₹36.9 lakh crore having been transferred via DBT since its inception in 2013.The Survey says, the all-India annual unemployment rate (persons aged 15 years and above, as per usual status) has been declining since the pandemic and this has been accompanied by a rise in the labour force participation rate and worker-to-population ratio. From the gender perspective, the female labour force participation rate has been rising for six years, i.e., from 23.3 per cent in 2017-18 to 37 per cent in 2022-23, driven mainly by the rising participation of rural women.India’s real GDP is projected to grow between 6.5–7 per cent in 2024-25.

The Survey cautions that any escalation of geopolitical conflicts in 2024 may lead to supply dislocations, higher commodity prices, reviving inflationary pressures, and stalling monetary policy easing with potential repercussions for capital flows. The global trade outlook for 2024 remains positive, with merchandise trade expected to pick up after registering a contraction in volumes in 2023. India's service exports have remained robust, reaching a new high of USD 341.1 billion in FY24, while the Current Account Deficit stood at 0.7% of the GDP during the year, an improvement from the deficit of 2.0% of GDP in FY23. The Indian Rupee has been one of the least volatile currencies among its emerging market peers in FY24, and external debt vulnerability indicators continue to be benign. The Survey highlights that leveraging initiatives taken by the government and capturing the untapped potential in emerging markets can expand exports of business, consultancy, and IT-enabled services.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a statement before the Budget Session, emphasizing the significance of his government's third term and the upcoming Budget's role in setting the direction for the next five years.

"PREFACE OF ECONOMIC SURVEY 2023-24 CALLS FOR STEERING THE COUNTRY THROUGH MULTIPLE COMPACTS AND CONSENSUS WITH GOVERNMENTS, PRIVATE SECTOR AND ACADMIA",https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034961,"The tripartite compact that India needs to become a developed nation amidst emerging unprecedented global challenges is for Centre and State Governments to trust and let go, for the private sector to reciprocate the trust with long-term thinking and fair conduct and for the public to take responsibility for their finances and their physical and mental health, this was stated by the Economic Survey 2023-24, tabled by Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament, today.The Economic Survey states that the return of the National Democratic Alliance Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi with a historic mandate for the third term signals political and policy continuity. The Survey mentions that after recovery from the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Indian economy is on a strong wicket and stable footing, demonstrating resilience in the face of geopolitical challenges. However, for the recovery to be sustained, there has to be heavy lifting on the domestic front because the environment has become extraordinarily difficult to reach agreements on key global issues such as trade, investment and climate.STRONG INDIAN ECONOMYThe Survey notes, inter alia, that there are many encouraging signs for the Indian economy: INVESTMENT INTEREST OF EXTERNAL INVESTORSCiting RBI data, the Survey noted that although India’s Balance of Payments shows us that the investment interest of external investors, measured in terms of dollar inflows of new capital, was $45.8 billion in FY24 compared to $47.6 billion in FY23, but the Foreign Direct Investment in India has held up. This slight decline is in line with global trends. The Survey noted that the repatriation of investment was USD29.3 billion in FY23 and USD44.5 billion in FY24.The Survey states that many private equity investors took advantage of buoyant equity markets in India and exited profitably. It is a sign of a healthy market environment that offers profitable exits to investors, which will bring newer investments in the years to come.The Survey notes that the current environment for foreign direct investment to grow in the coming years is not highly favourable due to:INFLUENCE OF SHOCKS ON EMPLOYMENTOn employment generation, citing the Periodic Labour Force Survey, the Survey mentions that a surge in agriculture employment is partly explained by reverse migration and the entry of women into the labour force in rural India.And citing Annual Survey of Industries, the Survey notes that the total number of factory jobs grew annually by 3.6% between 2013-14 and 2021-22, and they grew faster at 4.0% in factories employing more than a hundred workers than in smaller factories (those with less than a hundred workers). In absolute numbers, the Survey states that the employment in Indian factories has grown from 1.04 crore to 1.36 crore in this period.Citing the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Enterprises for 2022-23 in comparison with the results of the NSS 73rd round of the ‘Key Indicators of Unincorporated Non-Agricultural Enterprises (Excluding Construction) in India’, the Survey observes that it shows an overall employment in these enterprises fell from 11.1 crore in 2015-16 to 10.96 crore. There was a reduction of 54 lakh workers in manufacturing but the expansion of the workforce in trade and services gained in jobs limited the overall reduction in the number of workers in unincorporated enterprises to around 16.45 lakhs between these two periods. This comparison masks a big jump in manufacturing jobs that seems to have occurred between 2021-22 (April 2021 to March 2022) and 2022-23 (October 2022 to September 2023), it argued.Taking stock of the two big economic shocks in quick succession – the Non Performing Assets (NPA) in banking combined with high corporate indebtedness, and the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Survey observes that the global backdrop for India’s march towards Viksit Bharat in 2047 could not be more different from what it was during the rise of China between 1980 and 2015.The Survey notes that in the modern world, de-globalisation, geopolitics, climate change and global warming, and advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) casts a huge pall of uncertainty for India as to its impact on workers across all skill levels – low, semi and high. These will create barriers and hurdles to sustained high growth rates for India in the coming years and decades. The Survey states that overcoming these challenges requires a grand alliance of union and state governments and the private sector.EMPLOYMENT GENERATION: REAL BOTTOM LINE FOR PRIVATE SECTORThe Survey espoused a tripartite compact between private sector, Centre and State Governments to deliver on the higher and rising aspirations of Indians and complete the journey to Viksit Bharat by 2047 as job creation happens mainly in the private sector, and many (not all) of the issues that influence economic growth, job creation and productivity and the actions to be taken therein are in the domain of state governments.Citing the results of a sample of over 33,000 companies, the Survey states that in the three years between FY20 and FY23, the profit before taxes of the Indian corporate sector nearly quadrupled and therefore, in terms of financial performance, the action lies with the private sector.The Survey argues that it is in the enlightened self interest of the Indian corporate sector, swimming in excess profits, to take its responsibility to create jobs seriously and find people with the right attitude and skills.COMPACT BETWEEN PRIVATE SECTOR, GOVERNMENT AND ACADMIAThe Survey also explores the idea of another tripartite compact - between the Government, the private sector and academia. This compact is to reboot the mission to skill and equip Indians to catch up with and get ahead of technological evolution. To succeed in the mission, governments must unshackle the industry and academic institutions to play their respective roles in that mammoth task.THE REAL CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITYThe Survey also espoused a greater role for the corporate sector by nurturing and sustaining a culture of investing for the long term. Second, just as corporate profits are booming, the net interest margin of Indian banks has risen to a multi-year high. It is a good thing. Profitable banks lend more.To sustain the good times, the Survey noted that it is important not to forget the lessons of the last financial cycle downturn. The banking industry must aim to lengthen the gap between two NPA cycles. The Survey further notes that corporates benefit from the higher demand generated by employment and income growth. The financial sector benefits from channelling household savings for investment purposes. The Survey states that these linkages must grow stronger and last longer to meet the infrastructure and energy transition investments in the coming decades.The Survey also talks about India’s working-age population to be gainfully employed, for which they need skills and good health. The Survey stated that social media, screen time, sedentary habits, and unhealthy food are a lethal mix that can undermine public health and productivity and diminish India’s economic potential.The Survey argues for India’s traditional lifestyle, food and recipes that have shown how to live healthily and in harmony with nature and the environment for centuries. It makes commercial sense for Indian businesses to learn about and embrace them, for they have a global market waiting to be led rather than tapped.The Survey also argues that policymakers – elected or appointed – have to rise to the challenge as well. There has to be conversation, cooperation, collaboration, and coordination across ministries, States, and between the Union and States. Noting that this challenge is easier said than done and that it has not been done before on this scale, not in the time frame and not amidst a turbulent global environment, the Survey called for forging and sustaining consensus between governments, businesses and the social sectors are necessary to succeed in this endeavour.The Survey argued for the Indian state to free up its capacity and enhance its capability to focus on areas where it has to by letting go of its grip in areas where it does not have to. The Licensing, Inspection and Compliance requirements that all levels of the government continue to impose on businesses is an onerous burden. The Survey notes that relative to history, the burden has lightened. Relative to where it ought to be, it is still a lot heavier. The burden is felt more acutely by those least equipped to bear it – small and medium enterprises. The Survey cites Ishopanishad that enjoins all of us to let go of (renounce) our possessions, be free and enjoy that freedom:The tripartite compact that India needs to become a developed nation amidst emerging unprecedented global challenges is for Centre and State Governments to trust and let go, for the private sector to reciprocate the trust with long-term thinking and fair conduct and for the public to take responsibility for their finances and their physical and mental health, this was stated by the Economic Survey 2023-24, tabled by Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt.

SUSTAINING AND ACCELERATING INDIAS PROGRESS IN THE FACE OF EVOLVING CHALLENGES REQUIRES DEDICATED INVESTMENT IN STATE MACHINERY TO REINVENT AND REINVIGORATE ITSELF - ECONOMIC SURVEY 2023-24,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034957,"Enhancing state capacity and capability is critical to ensure that the growth strategy for Indian economy in medium term outlook achieves fruition. This was stated by Economic Survey 2023-24, tabled by Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today. Sustaining and accelerating India's progress in the face of evolving challenges requires dedicated investment in state machinery to reinvent and reinvigorate itself, says the Survey. It says that since 2014, India has made significant strides in delivering crucial infrastructure and implementing direct benefit schemes aimed at enhancing citizens’ well-being and the civil service has been at the heart of these transformative efforts.  The Survey notes that the government has responded to the challenge of building state capacity by launching Mission Karmayogi, which deconstructs the problem into more tractable sub - components. It says the program builds a much-needed bridge between capacity building and human resource management systems by connecting workplace roles and workers’ competencies.   The Survey says that capacity-building programmes, both in terms of pre-service training and ongoing professional development, can be designed to build the specific competencies that a civil servant needs to perform their role well. It says the iGOT Karmayogi platform is rapidly shaping into a central node that enables civil servants to access tailored and needbased capacity-building modules, track their competency requirements and gaps, and share knowledge and learnings across departments. The Survey adds that in recent years, the Government has made a significant beginning in lateral entry into the senior ranks of Central Ministries through a transparent process and recommends that this needs to be substantially expanded. It says foundational and mid-career training for civil servants in all specialities has to be re-imagined for the recharging and rebooting of skills, aptitude and attitudes. Length of tenure too is critical to grow into the demands of, and be productive and purposeful, in senior roles. Accountability mechanisms and practices will become necessary, if not already, to ensure policy outcomes at scale and speed. Annual conversations on goals and measurement – at the beginning and the end of the year – at senior levels will usher in professionalism and accountability, the Survey mentions.

INFRASTRUCTURE EXPANSION IN INDIA WITNESSES SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN RECENT YEARS: ECONOMIC SURVEY 2023-24,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034955,"With increased public investment over the last five years, India has witnessed significant expansion in physical and digital connectivity and social infrastructure including sanitation and water supply helping to improve quality of life of the people, states the Economic Survey 2023-24 tabled by Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today. The Survey notes that the foremost among the responses initiated by the Union Government to overcome the pandemic-driven slowdown in the economy was increase in capital expenditure, aimed particularly at the creation of high quality physical and social infrastructure facilities. Keeping the momentum going over the last five years, the Survey says, capital expenditure of the Government has seen an almost three-fold increase in FY24, relative to FY20 levels. It added that the major beneficiaries of this step-up are key foundational assets like roads and railways.ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE:The Economic Survey observes that strategic planning and step-up in public investment have resulted in the upgradation of the road network system into a resilient and efficient infrastructure. The capital investment by the Government and private sector rose from 0.4 per cent in FY15 to about 1.0 per cent of GDP (around ₹3.01 lakh crore) in FY24. The sector has attracted its highest-ever private investment in FY24 as the private sector capitalises on a conducive policy environment, mentions the Survey.Referring to the significant progress in the development of national highways, the Survey says that the development of national highways, over the last ten years, has increased by 1.6 times from 2014 to 2024. It states that the Bharatmala Pariyojana has significantly expanded the national highway network, increasing the length of high-speed corridors by 12 times and 4-lane roads by 2.6 times between 2014 and 2024. Further, the Survey notes that the efficiency of highway construction has improved due to the systematic push through the corridor-based National Highway development approach. The average pace of NH construction increased by 3 times from 11.7 km per day in FY14 to 34 km per day by FY24, it states. The survey observes that the remarkable improvement of the NH network has brought about substantial advancements in logistics efficiency which  is evidenced by the consistently rising India’s ranking in the World Bank’s ‘Logistics Performance Index, from 54 in 2014 and 44 in 2018, to 38 in 2023.To further enhance logistic efficiency, the Economic Survey has mentioned that the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRT&H) has dedicated Multi-Modal Logistics Parks (MMLP). It says that a total of six multimodal logistics parks (MMLPs) have been awarded until FY24, and ₹2,505 crore have been awarded for dedicated multimodal logistics parks (MMLPs) in FY24. Further, it stated, seven MMLPs are planned to be awarded in FY25.RAILWAYS INFRASTRUCTUREAccording to Economic Survey 2023-24, Indian Railways, with over 68,584 route km (as of 31st March 2024) and 12.54 lakh employees (as of 1st April 2024), is the fourth largest network in the world under single management. Survey states that the capital expenditure on Railways has increased by 77 per cent over the past 5 years (₹2.62 lakh crore in FY24) with significant investments in the construction of new lines, gauge conversion, and doubling.The Survey notes that the Railways has  achieved its highest-ever production for both locomotives and wagons in FY24. Survey states that 51 pairs of Vande Bharat have been introduced until March 2024. The fast pace of infrastructure augmentation has been the result of a substantial increase in financial allocation along with close project monitoring and regular follow-up with stakeholders for expeditious land acquisition and clearances, the Survey observes.The Survey has also mentioned about the initiatives undertaken by Railways for providing clean environment in and around railway stations and trains, such as replacement of conventional toilets with bio-toilets on coaches leading to clean tracks, segregation of bio-degradable/non bio-degradable waste, solid waste management and discouraging use of single use plastic.The key focus areas for Railways, according to Economic Survey 2023-24 include fast capacity augmentation, modernisation of rolling stock and maintenance, improving quality of services and energy efficiency. In line with this, the Survey states that the  investments are prioritised in areas like dedicated freight corridors, high-speed rail, modern passenger services like Vande Bharat, Amrit Bharat Express, Aastha Special Trains, high-capacity rolling stock and last-mile rail linkages. Projects for three major corridors viz. (1) High-traffic density corridors, (2) Energy, Mineral and Cement Corridors and (3) Rail Sagar (port connectivity) corridors are also planned to reduce logistics cost and carbon footprint, the Survey said. As per the Survey,  Railways has also planned to reduce its carbon footprint primarily through sourcing of its energy requirements through renewable energy sources and the expected requirement of installation of renewable capacity by 2029-30 is around 30 Giga Watts. Other strategies mentioned by Survey  include shifting from diesel to electric traction, promotion of energy efficiency and afforestation.With increased public investment over the last five years, India has witnessed significant expansion in physical and digital connectivity and social infrastructure including sanitation and water supply helping to improve quality of life of the people, states the Economic Survey 2023-24 tabled by Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today.

INDIAN ECONOMY NEEDS TO GENERATE NEARLY 78.5 LAKH JOBS ANNUALLY IN THE NON-FARM SECTOR UNTIL 2030 TO CATER TO THE RISING WORKFORCE,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034952,"With the global labour market amidst a ‘disruption,’ and constantly being reshaped by the fourth industrial revolution, the Economic Survey 2023-24 tabled in Parliament by Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, recognizes that India would also not remain immune to the transformation caused by it. REQUIREMENT OF JOB CREATION UNTIL 2036The Economic Survey 2023-24 notes that Indian economy needs to generate an average of nearly 78.5 lakh jobs annually until 2030 in the non-farm sector to cater to the rising workforce.The Survey mentions that there is a scope to supplement the existing schemes of Production Linked Incentive (PLI) (60 lakh employment generation over 5 years), MITRA Textile scheme (20 lakh employment generation), MUDRA, etc., while boosting their implementation. AI: THE BIGGEST DISRUPTORWhile attributing the biggest disruption in the future of work to the accelerated growth in AI, the Economic Survey 2023-24 says that India, with its vast demographic dividend and a very young population, is uniquely situated as AI poses both risk and opportunity. A particular risk is the BPO sector, where GenAI is revolutionising the performance of routine cognitive tasks through chatbots, and employment in the sector is estimated to decline considerably in the next ten years. In the following decade, however, gradual diffusion of AI is expected to augment productivity. But given the affinity of India’s population to work with technology, as seen with the digital public infrastructure, proactive interventions by the Government and industry can position India as a key player in the AI age, the Economic Survey notes. MAKING THE MOST OF AI IN INDIAThe Government has launched several initiatives to ensure an AI enabled ecosystem and to connect AI to the youth of the country. Some of these include ‘Future Skills Prime’, ‘YUVAi: Youth for Unnati and Vikas with AI’ a national programme for school students and ‘ResponsibleAI for Youth 2022’. A budget of ₹10,300 crore has been provided in 2024 for the India AI Mission, a significant move to strengthen the AI ecosystem.A SHIFT TOWARDS GIG ECONOMYAccording to NITI Aayog’s indicative estimates based on national labour force survey data, in 2020–21, 77 lakh (7.7 million) workers were engaged in the gig economy and as per the Economic Survey 2023-24, the gig workforce is expected to expand to 2.35 crore (23.5 million) and form 6.7 per cent per cent of the non-agricultural workforce or 4.1 per cent of the total livelihood in India by 2029–30.  The Survey mentions that the significant contribution in the Indian context and globally has been the creation of effective social security initiatives for gig and platform workers. The Code on Social Security (2020) marks a significant advancement by expanding the scope of social security benefits to encompass gig and platform workers.Recognizing the climate change as a hard reality of the present times and projections pointing towards an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, the Survey mentions its concomitant outcome as the possible loss of jobs and productivity.INDIA’S CORPORATE SECTOR ON RISEIt mentions that businesses have an obligation to themselves to strike the right balance between deployment of capital and deployment of labour. In their fascination for AI and fear of erosion of competitiveness, businesses have to bear in mind their responsibility for employment generation and the consequent impact on social stability.The Economic Survey 2023-24 says that India can utilise the range of products on offer by its different agro-climatic zones and productively engage the sizeable rural workforce, comprising women who seek remunerative part-time employment and educated youth who can be technically skilled to handle small to medium scale agro-processing units.The care economy holds great importance for a young country like India, which has both demographic and gender dividends to reap. Highlighting the need to prepare for future care requirements of an ageing population, the Economic Survey 2023-24 says that defining care work is the first step towards acknowledging care as ‘work’. It mentions that India’s care needs are slated to expand significantly in the next 25 years, as an ageing population follows the ongoing demographic transition while the population of children stays relatively sizeable. By 2050, the share of children is estimated to decline to 18 per cent (i.e., 30 crore persons), while the proportion of elderly persons would rise to 20.8 per cent (i.e., 34.7 crore persons). Thus, compared to 50.7 crore persons in 2022, the country would need to care for 64.7 crore persons in 2050.The care responsibility associated with an increasingly older population necessitates formulating a future-ready wholesome elderly care policy with the Survey mentioning the care economy as a top-tier entry in India’s to-do list for becoming a developed nation by 2047. According to the Asian Development Bank report, utilising this ‘silver dividend’ of untapped work capacity of population aged 60-69 years is estimated to increase GDP by an average of 1.5 per cent for Asian economies.

Nearly two-thirds of the new subscribers in the EPFO payroll have been from the 18-28 years band.State-wise, the top six states in terms of the number of factories, were also the greatest factory employment creators. More than 40 per cent of factory employment was in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. In contrast, the highest employment growth between FY18 and FY22 was seen in states with a higher share of young population, including Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.The Survey also mentions the rising heft of computers and electronics, rubber and plastic products, and chemicals indicating  that Indian manufacturing is moving up the value chain and have emerged as sunrise sectors for manufacturing employment generation.EPFO Enrolment on rise The organised sector job market conditions measured by payroll data for EPFO indicate a consistent year-on-year (YoY) increase in payroll addition since FY19 (the earliest since datais available). The yearly net payroll additions to the EPFO more than doubled from 61.1 lakh in FY19 to 131.5 lakh in FY24, swiftly recovering from the pandemic aided by the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY).

This has been accompanied by a boost to self-employment through easing of access to credit, and multiple process reforms. The Survey mentions some of the initiatives to foster job creation and workers’ welfare such as launch of National Career Service (NCS) Portal, e-Shram portal, introduction of Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY) for boosting employment with social security benefits post-COVID-19 job losses, programmes such as One Nation One Ration Card and amalgamation of  29 Central Laws into four Labour Codes in 2019 and 2020.Trend in rural wagesThe Economic Survey 2023-24 mentions that in FY24, rural wages rose at above-5 per cent every month, Y-o-Y and on an average, nominal wage rates in agriculture grew by 7.4 per cent for men and 7.7 per cent for women, benefitting from robust agriculture growth during the period. The wage growth in non-agricultural activities was at 6.0 per cent for men and 7.4 per cent for women during the same period.

STELLAR PERFORMACE OF INDIA’s BANKING AND FINANCIAL SECTOR AMIDST GLOBAL HEADWINDS,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034950,"Indian economy's financial and banking sectors have shown strong performance despite continuous geopolitical challenges, said the Economic Survey 2023-24 tabled by Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in the Parliament today. The survey notes that the Central Bank maintained a steady policy rate throughout the year, with the overall inflation rate under control. The effects of the monetary tightening following the Russia-Ukraine conflict are evident in the lending and deposit interest rates increase among banks. Bank loans saw significant and widespread growth across various sectors, with personal loans and services leading the way.Monetary PolicyThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) maintained the status quo on the policy repo rate at 6.5 per cent in FY24. During the current tightening cycle, i.e., from May 2022 to May 2024, the external benchmark-based lending rate and the one-year median marginal-cost-of-funds based lending rate increased by 250 bps and 175 bps, respectively. Important factors impacting the evolution of monetary and credit conditions during FY24 were the withdrawal of ₹2,000 banknotes (May 2023), the merger of HDFC, a non-bank, with HDFC Bank (July 2023), and the temporary imposition of the incremental CRR (I-CRR) (August 2023).The growth in Broad Money (M3), excluding the impact of the merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank (with effect from 1 July 2023), was 11.2 per cent (YoY) as of 22 March 2024, compared to 9 per cent a year ago.During FY24, 17 fortnightly Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) auctions and seven Variable Rate Repo (VRR) auctions were undertaken as the primary operation. In addition, 49 fine-tuning operations (25 VRRR and 24 VRR) were conducted intermittently, modulating liquidity conditions in alignment with the monetary policy stance, the survey notes.Bank CreditCredit growth remains robust, mainly driven by lending to services and personal loans.Lending by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) accelerated, led by personal loans and loans to the industry, and their asset quality improved. Credit disbursal by SCBs stood at ₹164.3 lakh crore, growing by 20.2 per cent at the end of March 2024, compared to 15 per cent growth at the end of March 2023.Agricultural credit increased nearly 1.5 times from ₹13.3 lakh crore in FY21 to ₹20.7 lakh crore in FY24. The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme played a pivotal role in providing timely and hassle-free credit to farmers, with over 7.4 crore operative KCC accounts at the end of 2023.Industrial credit growth picked up in H2 of FY24, registering 8.5 per cent growth in March 2024, compared to 5.2 per cent a year ago, driven by an increase in bank credit to small and large industries.Improving credit flow to the MSME sector at low cost has been a policy priority of the Government and RBI. Bank credit disbursal to the services sector remained resilient despite a slowdown in credit growth to NBFCs Credit disbursal for housing loans increased from ₹19.9 lakh crore in March 2023 to ₹27.2 lakh crore in March 2024.Banking SectorThere has been a significant enhancement in the asset quality of banks, led by improved borrower selection, more effective debt recovery and heightened debt awareness among large borrowers. In addition to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, qualitative metrics such as enhanced disclosures, robust code of conduct, and transparent governance structures also improved banking performance.The gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio of SCBs continued its downward trend, reaching a 12-year low of 2.8 per cent at the end of March 2024 from its peak of 11.2 per cent in FY18.The macro-and micro-prudential measures by RBI and the Government have enhanced risk absorption capacity in recent years, improving the banking system's stability. For the top 10 Indian banks in asset size, loans constitute more than 50 per cent of their total assets, making banks immune to the rising interest rate cycle.In the eight years since 2016, 31,394 corporate debtors involving a value of ₹13.9 lakh crore have been disposed of (including pre-admission case disposals) as of March 2024. ₹10.2 lakh crore of underlying defaults were addressed at the pre-admission stage. The Government has taken several measures to improve the insolvency ecosystem. It has strengthened the NCLT regarding infrastructure, increasing its strength by filling vacancies and proposing an integrated IT platform. The regulations have been amended to keep in line with the needs of the markets and the advances in judicial pronouncements, the survey notes.Strong Primary MarketsThe Survey highlights the remarkable expansion of Indian capital markets. Capital markets have shown impressive results, with India's stock market capitalisation to GDP ratio ranking fifth globally. Primary markets remained robust during FY24, facilitating capital formation of ₹10.9 lakh crore (which approximates 29 per cent of the gross fixed capital formation of private and public corporates during FY23), compared to ₹9.3 lakh crore in FY23. Fund mobilisation through all three modes, viz., equity, debt, and hybrid, increased by 24.9 per cent, 12.1 per cent and 513.6 per cent, respectively, in FY24 compared to the previous year.The number of initial public offers (IPOs) increased by 66 per cent in FY24 from 164 in FY23 to 272 in FY24, while the amount raised grew by 24 per cent (from ₹54,773 crore in FY23 to ₹67,995 crore in FY24). The corporate debt market in India is going from strength to strength. During FY24, the value of corporate bond issuances increased to ₹8.6 lakh crore from ₹7.6 lakh crore during the previous financial year. The number of corporate bonds public issues in FY24 was the highest for any financial year so far, with the amount raised (₹19,167 crore) at a four-year high. Increasing investor demand and the rise in the cost of borrowing from banks have made these markets more attractive for corporates for funding requirements. Robust Secondary MarketsIndian stock market was among the best-performing markets, with India’s Nifty 50 index ascending by 26.8 per cent during FY24, as against (-)8.2 per cent during FY23. The Survey says that the exemplary performance of the Indian stock market compared to the world can be primarily attributed to India’s resilience to global geo-political and economic shocks, its solid and stable domestic macroeconomic outlook, and the strength of the domestic investor base. The Indian capital markets have seen a surge in retail activity in the last few years. The registered investor base at NSE has nearly tripled from March 2020 to March 2024 to 9.2 crore as of 31 March 2024, potentially translating into 20 per cent of the Indian households now channelling their household savings into financial markets. The number of demat accounts rose from 11.45 crore in FY23 to 15.14 crore in FY24. FY24 has been a spectacular year for Mutual Funds as their Assets under Management (AuM) increased by ₹14 lakh crore (YoY growth of 35 per cent) to ₹53.4 lakh crore at the end of FY24, boosted by mark-to-market (MTM) gains and expansion of the industry. Economic Survey notes that the significant increase in retail investors in the stock market calls for careful consideration as there is the possibility of overconfidence leading to speculation. It says that the firms operating in banking and capital markets must keep the interests of the consumers in mind through fair selling, disclosure, transparency, reliability, and responsiveness.Progress of financial inclusionThe Survey highlights that the Government has prioritised delivering financial services to the last mile. The number of adults with an account in a formal financial institution increased from 35 per cent in 2011 to 77 per cent in 2021. Not only there is a decline in the access gap between the rich and the poor but the gender divide in terms of financial inclusion has also narrowed. Survey notes a shift in focus of the financial inclusion strategy in the country, from ‘every household’ to ‘every adult,’ with added emphasis on direct benefit transfer (DBT) flows, promoting digital payments using RuPay cards, UPI123 etc. Highlighting the progress of financial inclusion so far in the country, the survey says that India is among the fastest-growing fintech markets in the World, hailing as the third-largest growing fintech economy. A key enabler of this financial inclusion drive has been the digitalisation of the financial system, which the survey terms “transformative”. ‘Digital financial inclusion (DFI)’ is the next big target of the government. The survey says that the COVID-19 pandemic gave further momentum to Digital financial inclusion (DFI) when the most vulnerable and excluded citizens were severely affected.  Some flagship schemes such as the Digital India Mission, Make-in-India, Aadhaar, e-KYC, Aadhaar-enabled Payment System, UPI, Bharat QR, DigiLocker, e-sign, Account Aggregator, Open Network for Digital Commerce, etc came to the rescue.The success of UPI has been enhanced by the expansion of smartphone usage in India, with more than 116.5 crore smartphone subscribers as of 31 March 2024. The value of transactions conducted on the UPI platform has increased multifold from ₹0.07 lakh crore in FY17 to ₹200 lakh crore in FY24.Microfinance has been playing an essential role in meeting low-income households' credit needs by providing affordable doorstep services. Globally, the Indian microfinance sector is the second largest after China in terms of number of borrowing customers in India, which are about three times that of the next biggest market, i.e., Indonesia. Insurance sectorThe survey says that the insurance sector has seen a remarkable growth. India is poised to emerge as one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the coming decade. Economic growth, an expanding middle class, innovation, and regulatory support have driven insurance market growth in India. Non-life premium growth moderated slightly from 9 per cent in FY22 to an estimated 7.7 per cent in as the market stabilised after the pandemic.  Recently, Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) achieved a milestone of generating 34.2 crore Ayushman cards across India, with 49.3 per cent of them held by females.Pension sector Talking about the developments in the pension sector, the survey states that India's pension sector has expanded since the introduction of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and, more recently, the Atal Pension Yojana (APY). The total number of subscribers stood at 735.6 lakh as of March 2024, registering a YoY growth of 18 per cent from 623.6 lakh as of March 2023. The total number of APY subscribers (including its earlier version, NPS Lite) increased from 501.2 lakh as of March 2023 to 588.4 lakh as of March 2024. APY subscribers account for around 80 per cent of the pension subscriber base. APY subscribers have witnessed an improvement in gender mix, with female subscriber share rising from 37.2 per cent in FY17 to 48.5 per cent in FY23.The survey also mentions the mechanisms to ensure regulatory coordination and overall financial stability, which should withstand unforeseen shocks so that there is a high degree of confidence. It recognizes the key role of Financial Sector Development Council (FSDC) to deal with a wide range of issues relating to financial stability and financial sector development.  Indian economy's financial and banking sectors have shown strong performance despite continuous geopolitical challenges, said the Economic Survey 2023-24 tabled by Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in the Parliament today. The survey notes that the Central Bank maintained a steady policy rate throughout the year, with the overall inflation rate under control. The effects of the monetary tightening following the Russia-Ukraine conflict are evident in the lending and deposit interest rates increase among banks. Bank loans saw significant and widespread growth across various sectors, with personal loans and services leading the way.Monetary PolicyThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) maintained the status quo on the policy repo rate at 6.5 per cent in FY24.

Important factors impacting the evolution of monetary and credit conditions during FY24 were the withdrawal of ₹2,000 banknotes (May 2023), the merger of HDFC, a non-bank, with HDFC Bank (July 2023), and the temporary imposition of the incremental CRR (I-CRR) (August 2023).The growth in Broad Money (M3), excluding the impact of the merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank (with effect from 1 July 2023), was 11.2 per cent (YoY) as of 22 March 2024, compared to 9 per cent a year ago.During FY24, 17 fortnightly Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) auctions and seven Variable Rate Repo (VRR) auctions were undertaken as the primary operation. In addition, 49 fine-tuning operations (25 VRRR and 24 VRR) were conducted intermittently, modulating liquidity conditions in alignment with the monetary policy stance, the survey notes.Bank CreditCredit growth remains robust, mainly driven by lending to services and personal loans.Lending by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) accelerated, led by personal loans and loans to the industry, and their asset quality improved. Credit disbursal by SCBs stood at ₹164.3 lakh crore, growing by 20.2 per cent at the end of March 2024, compared to 15 per cent growth at the end of March 2023.Agricultural credit increased nearly 1.5 times from ₹13.3 lakh crore in FY21 to ₹20.7 lakh crore in FY24. The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme played a pivotal role in providing timely and hassle-free credit to farmers, with over 7.4 crore operative KCC accounts at the end of 2023.Industrial credit growth picked up in H2 of FY24, registering 8.5 per cent growth in March 2024, compared to 5.2 per cent a year ago, driven by an increase in bank credit to small and large industries.Improving credit flow to the MSME sector at low cost has been a policy priority of the Government and RBI. Bank credit disbursal to the services sector remained resilient despite a slowdown in credit growth to NBFCs Credit disbursal for housing loans increased from ₹19.9 lakh crore in March 2023 to ₹27.2 lakh crore in March 2024.Banking SectorThere has been a significant enhancement in the asset quality of banks, led by improved borrower selection, more effective debt recovery and heightened debt awareness among large borrowers. In addition to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, qualitative metrics such as enhanced disclosures, robust code of conduct, and transparent governance structures also improved banking performance.The gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio of SCBs continued its downward trend, reaching a 12-year low of 2.8 per cent at the end of March 2024 from its peak of 11.2 per cent in FY18.The macro-and micro-prudential measures by RBI and the Government have enhanced risk absorption capacity in recent years, improving the banking system's stability. For the top 10 Indian banks in asset size, loans constitute more than 50 per cent of their total assets, making banks immune to the rising interest rate cycle.In the eight years since 2016, 31,394 corporate debtors involving a value of ₹13.9 lakh crore have been disposed of (including pre-admission case disposals) as of March 2024. ₹10.2 lakh crore of underlying defaults were addressed at the pre-admission stage. The Government has taken several measures to improve the insolvency ecosystem. It has strengthened the NCLT regarding infrastructure, increasing its strength by filling vacancies and proposing an integrated IT platform. The regulations have been amended to keep in line with the needs of the markets and the advances in judicial pronouncements, the survey notes.Strong Primary MarketsThe Survey highlights the remarkable expansion of Indian capital markets. Capital markets have shown impressive results, with India's stock market capitalisation to GDP ratio ranking fifth globally. Primary markets remained robust during FY24, facilitating capital formation of ₹10.9 lakh crore (which approximates 29 per cent of the gross fixed capital formation of private and public corporates during FY23), compared to ₹9.3 lakh crore in FY23. Fund mobilisation through all three modes, viz., equity, debt, and hybrid, increased by 24.9 per cent, 12.1 per cent and 513.6 per cent, respectively, in FY24 compared to the previous year.The number of initial public offers (IPOs) increased by 66 per cent in FY24 from 164 in FY23 to 272 in FY24, while the amount raised grew by 24 per cent (from ₹54,773 crore in FY23 to ₹67,995 crore in FY24). The corporate debt market in India is going from strength to strength. During FY24, the value of corporate bond issuances increased to ₹8.6 lakh crore from ₹7.6 lakh crore during the previous financial year. The number of corporate bonds public issues in FY24 was the highest for any financial year so far, with the amount raised (₹19,167 crore) at a four-year high. Increasing investor demand and the rise in the cost of borrowing from banks have made these markets more attractive for corporates for funding requirements. Robust Secondary MarketsIndian stock market was among the best-performing markets, with India’s Nifty 50 index ascending by 26.8 per cent during FY24, as against (-)8.2 per cent during FY23. The Survey says that the exemplary performance of the Indian stock market compared to the world can be primarily attributed to India’s resilience to global geo-political and economic shocks, its solid and stable domestic macroeconomic outlook, and the strength of the domestic investor base. The Indian capital markets have seen a surge in retail activity in the last few years. The registered investor base at NSE has nearly tripled from March 2020 to March 2024 to 9.2 crore as of 31 March 2024, potentially translating into 20 per cent of the Indian households now channelling their household savings into financial markets. The number of demat accounts rose from 11.45 crore in FY23 to 15.14 crore in FY24. FY24 has been a spectacular year for Mutual Funds as their Assets under Management (AuM) increased by ₹14 lakh crore (YoY growth of 35 per cent) to ₹53.4 lakh crore at the end of FY24, boosted by mark-to-market (MTM) gains and expansion of the industry. Economic Survey notes that the significant increase in retail investors in the stock market calls for careful consideration as there is the possibility of overconfidence leading to speculation. It says that the firms operating in banking and capital markets must keep the interests of the consumers in mind through fair selling, disclosure, transparency, reliability, and responsiveness.Progress of financial inclusionThe Survey highlights that the Government has prioritised delivering financial services to the last mile. The number of adults with an account in a formal financial institution increased from 35 per cent in 2011 to 77 per cent in 2021. Not only there is a decline in the access gap between the rich and the poor but the gender divide in terms of financial inclusion has also narrowed. Survey notes a shift in focus of the financial inclusion strategy in the country, from ‘every household’ to ‘every adult,’ with added emphasis on direct benefit transfer (DBT) flows, promoting digital payments using RuPay cards, UPI123 etc. Highlighting the progress of financial inclusion so far in the country, the survey says that India is among the fastest-growing fintech markets in the World, hailing as the third-largest growing fintech economy. A key enabler of this financial inclusion drive has been the digitalisation of the financial system, which the survey terms “transformative”. ‘Digital financial inclusion (DFI)’ is the next big target of the government. The survey says that the COVID-19 pandemic gave further momentum to Digital financial inclusion (DFI) when the most vulnerable and excluded citizens were severely affected.  Some flagship schemes such as the Digital India Mission, Make-in-India, Aadhaar, e-KYC, Aadhaar-enabled Payment System, UPI, Bharat QR, DigiLocker, e-sign, Account Aggregator, Open Network for Digital Commerce, etc came to the rescue.The success of UPI has been enhanced by the expansion of smartphone usage in India, with more than 116.5 crore smartphone subscribers as of 31 March 2024. The value of transactions conducted on the UPI platform has increased multifold from ₹0.07 lakh crore in FY17 to ₹200 lakh crore in FY24.Microfinance has been playing an essential role in meeting low-income households' credit needs by providing affordable doorstep services. Globally, the Indian microfinance sector is the second largest after China in terms of number of borrowing customers in India, which are about three times that of the next biggest market, i.e., Indonesia. Insurance sectorThe survey says that the insurance sector has seen a remarkable growth. India is poised to emerge as one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the coming decade. Economic growth, an expanding middle class, innovation, and regulatory support have driven insurance market growth in India. Non-life premium growth moderated slightly from 9 per cent in FY22 to an estimated 7.7 per cent in as the market stabilised after the pandemic.  Recently, Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) achieved a milestone of generating 34.2 crore Ayushman cards across India, with 49.3 per cent of them held by females.Pension sector Talking about the developments in the pension sector, the survey states that India's pension sector has expanded since the introduction of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and, more recently, the Atal Pension Yojana (APY). The total number of subscribers stood at 735.6 lakh as of March 2024, registering a YoY growth of 18 per cent from 623.6 lakh as of March 2023. The total number of APY subscribers (including its earlier version, NPS Lite) increased from 501.2 lakh as of March 2023 to 588.4 lakh as of March 2024. APY subscribers account for around 80 per cent of the pension subscriber base. APY subscribers have witnessed an improvement in gender mix, with female subscriber share rising from 37.2 per cent in FY17 to 48.5 per cent in FY23.The survey also mentions the mechanisms to ensure regulatory coordination and overall financial stability, which should withstand unforeseen shocks so that there is a high degree of confidence. It recognizes the key role of Financial Sector Development Council (FSDC) to deal with a wide range of issues relating to financial stability and financial sector development.  ","The Indian economy's financial and banking sectors have shown strong performance despite continuous geopolitical challenges, according to the Economic Survey 2023-24 presented by Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Nirmala Sitharaman. The Central Bank maintained a steady policy rate throughout the year, with overall inflation under control. Bank loans saw significant and widespread growth across various sectors, with personal loans and services leading the way.

The corporate debt market in India has seen a surge in recent years, with 331,394 corporate debtors involving a value of ₹133.9 lakh crore being disposed of during FY24. The value of transactions conducted on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform has increased multifold from ₹0.07 lakh crore in FY17 to ₹200 lakh crore in FY24.

INDIA’S EXTERNAL SECTOR SHOWS RESILIENCE AMIDST GEOPOLITICAL HEADWINDS,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034949,"India’s external sector remained strong amidst ongoing geopolitical headwinds with services exports continuing to perform well. The overall trade deficit reduced from USD 121.6 billion in FY23 to USD 78.1 billion in FY24. This is stated in the Economic Survey 2023-24 tabled by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in the Parliament today. SERVICES TRADEThe Economic Survey highlights that the share of India’s services exports in world services exports has risen remarkably from 0.5 per cent in 1993 to 4.3 per cent in 2022. India is now the seventh-largest services exporting country globally rising phenomenally from its 24th position in 2001. Amongst services exports, software/IT services and business services exports have increased. This was supported by India emerging as a hub for Global Capability Centres (GCCs). India ranks 2nd in the world in telecommunication, computer, and information services exports, 6th in personal, cultural and recreational services exports and 8th in other business services exports.  The growth in Global Capability Centres (GCCs) is reflected in the services BoP, with ‘Other Business Services’ being the second-largest contributor in services exports in FY24 with a share of 26%. In 2012, about 760 GCCs were operating out of India and as of March 2023, India houses over 1,600 GCCs.MERCHANDISE TRADEIndia performed well in merchandise trade despite lowering in global demand with exports crossing USD 776 billion and imports reaching USD 898 billion in FY23. With this, merchandise trade deficit narrowed to USD 238.3 billion in FY24 compared to USD 264.9 billion in the previous year. There was a slowdown in India’s major exporting partners (especially the EU, whose real GDP grew barely by 0.6 per cent in 2023, compared to 3.6 per cent growth in 2024), along with the lagged impact of monetary tightening carried out by many countries to control rising inflation.The Survey notes that adverse trade environment in 2023 is expected to ease somewhat this year and next, boosting goods trade in 2024 and 2025. World merchandise trade volume is expected to grow at 2.6 per cent and 3.3 per cent in 2024 and 2025, respectively, as demand for traded goods rebounds.India’s exports of engineering goods, electronic goods and drugs & pharmaceuticals increased in FY24 on a YoY basis. India’s share in world electronics exports also improved. India maintained a strong foothold in the drugs and pharmaceuticals sector. Despite high domestic demand due to the relatively strong growth of India’s economy, merchandise imports contracted by 5.7 per cent in FY24, from USD 716 billion in FY23 to USD 675.4 billion in FY24. Imports of capital goods saw an increase, which is welcome as it indicates a heightened demand for machinery, equipment, and other durable goods used in production processes, suggesting potential investments in industrial infrastructure or technological upgrades. A marginal uptick in the share of consumer goods in merchandise imports reflects a stable but limited increase in the importation of finished products for direct consumption.A targeted focus and a series of measures undertaken by the Government has shown robust growth in product-specific exports in sectors such as – Defence, Toys, Footwear and Smartphones. The share of electronics goods in merchandise exports of India rose from 2.7 per cent in FY19 to 6.7 per cent in FY24, taking India from 28th position in 2018 to 24th in 2022 in global electronics exports.  MEASURES TO EXPAND EXPORTSThe Government has undertaken various measures to promote exports and reduce logistics costs involved in international trade which include setting export targets and their monitoring, provision of export credit insurance services and encouraging banks to provide affordable and adequate export credit to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) exporters, enabling them to explore new markets and diversify their existing products competitively.To boost efficiency and lower logistics costs, the Government launched the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan and the National Logistics Policy (NLP) in October 2021 and September 2022, respectively. Digital reforms, such as the Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) and the Logistics Data Bank, are additional measures taken towards improving logistics.Initiatives, such as railway track electrification, reduced release times by the Land Ports Authority of India (LPAI), and the launch of NLP Marine for port-related logistics were also undertaken. Since the launch of the NLP, over 614 industry players have registered on ULIP, 106 private companies have signed Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), 142 companies have submitted 382 use cases to be hosted on ULIP and 57 applications have been made live as of September 2023.The Survey notes that India stands for an open, inclusive, predictable, non-discriminatory, and mutually beneficial international trade as it can provide an impetus to economic growth. India advocates for a rule-based international trading system with these attributes with WTO at its core. In this spirit, India considers Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) an instrument of trade liberalisation and a complement to the multilateral trading system under WTO. Accordingly, the country is engaged with all its trading partners/blocs to expand its export markets while ensuring better terms for essential imports to meet domestic demand in a cost competitive manner.The Economic Survey highlighted that India is moving up the global value chains (GVCs), with the share of GVC-related trade in gross trade rising to 40.3 per cent in 2022 from 35.1 per cent in 2019. The improvement in GVC participation is also reflected in increased pure backward GVC participation. The Survey added that India’s GVC participation has begun to rev up again on the back of incentives provided through schemes such as the PLI and Districts as Exports Hub (DEH) initiative, after the lull seen in the years succeeding the global financial crisis. Survey says that the evidence of India’s enhanced global supply chain participation is reflected in increased investment by foreign firms in electronics, apparel and toys, automobiles and components, capital goods and semiconductor manufacturing in India.CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCEThe Economic Survey highlighted that India’s Current Account Deficit (CAD) narrowed to USD 23.2 billion (0.7 per cent of GDP) in FY24 from USD 67 billion (2 per cent of GDP) during the previous year due to a decline in merchandise trade deficit, rising net services exports and increasing remittances.The Net services receipts increased from USD 143.3 billion during FY23 to USD 162.8 billion in FY24, primarily on account of rising exports of software, travel and business services. The remittances by Indians employed overseas, was USD 106.6 billion in FY24, against USD 101.8 billion during the previous year.Remittances to India are forecasted to grow at 3.7 per cent to USD 124 billion in 2024 and at 4 per cent to reach USD 129 billion in 2025, emphasized the Survey.CAPITAL ACCOUNT BALANCEEmphasizing about the stable capital inflows which continue to finance the CAD, the Survey mentioned that during FY24, net capital flows stood at USD 86.3 billion against USD 58.9 billion during the previous year, primarily driven by FPI flows and net inflows of banking capital.The Survey emphasized that India witnessed positive net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows in FY24 of USD 44.1 billion, supported by strong economic growth, a stable business environment, and increased investor confidence.Highlighting that India received the highest equity inflows among emerging market peers during FY24, the Survey listed financial services, automobile and auto components, healthcare, and capital goods were the significant sectors attracting equity inflows during FY24.The Survey noted that the Net FDI inflows to India declined from USD 42.0 billion during FY23 to USD 26.5 billion in FY24 as an impact of decline in global FDI flows. It further added that the gross FDI inflows moderated only by 0.6 per cent from USD 71.4 billion in FY23 to just under USD 71 billion in FY24.Highlighting that India has a well-established infrastructure to attract FDI in select sectors, i.e., Greenfield projects such as renewables, digital services such as telecommunications, software and hardware, and consultancy services, the Economic Survey suggested that where investment intentions are high, the sectors must be made more accessible for investments. It further added that the focus must remain on improving the ease of doing business across sectors and extend beyond sectors attractive to FDI alone by working out the details across all levels of government – national, state and local - and across regulators.The Survey listed that educated labour and a skilled workforce coupled with a vibrant R&D culture are important magnets to enhance sustained investor interest, apart from political stability, policy predictability and stability, reasonable duties and taxes, dispute resolution mechanisms and ease of repatriation.The Survey highlighted that during FY24, India’s Foreign Exchange Reserve (FER) increased by USD 68 billion, the highest increase among major foreign exchange reserves-holding countries. The Survey notes that the Rupee emerged as the least volatile currency among its emerging market peers and a few advanced economies in FY24. It further stated that Rising FPI inflows kept the Indian Rupee in a manageable range of ₹82 to ₹83.5/USD in FY24.The Economic Survey says that Indian residents’ overseas financial assets, by end of March 2024, was at USD 1,028.3 billion were higher by USD 109.7 billion or 11.9 per cent compared to the level as of March 2023. The factors attributed were mainly due to a rise in reserve assets, currency and deposits, overseas direct investment, trade credit and advances and loans.  EXTERNAL DEBT The External debt to GDP ratio declined to 18.7 per cent at the end of March 2024 from 19.0 per cent at the end of March 2023. Survey added that comparing various debt vulnerability indicators of India with peer countries for 2022 indicates that India is in a better position with relatively low levels of total debt as a percentage of Gross National Income (GNI) and short-term external debt as a percentage of total external debt.The Economy survey noted that India’s trade deficit is expected to decline further as the PLI scheme is expanded and India creates a globally competitive manufacturing base in several product categories. It added that the recently signed FTAs are expected to increase the global market share of the country’s exports. The Survey mentioned that various international agencies and RBI expect the CAD to GDP to moderate to below one per cent for FY24, driven by growing merchandise and services exports and resilient remittances.The Survey listed the fall in demand from major trading partners, Rise in trade cost, Commodity price volatility, Trade policy changes as some of the major challenges to India’s balance of trade. The Survey suggested that the changing composition of India’s export basket, enhancement in trade-related infrastructure, enhanced quality consciousness and product safety considerations in the private sector and stable policy environment are expected to play a significant role in driving India’s rise as a global supplier of goods and services.NB/AD/VM/SR/AGIndia’s external sector remained strong amidst ongoing geopolitical headwinds with services exports continuing to perform well. The overall trade deficit reduced from USD 121.6 billion in FY23 to USD 78.1 billion in FY24.

Survey says that the evidence of India’s enhanced global supply chain participation is reflected in increased investment by foreign firms in electronics, apparel and toys, automobiles and components, capital goods and semiconductor manufacturing in India.CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCEThe Economic Survey highlighted that India’s Current Account Deficit (CAD) narrowed to USD 23.2 billion (0.7 per cent of GDP) in FY24 from USD 67 billion (2 per cent of GDP) during the previous year due to a decline in merchandise trade deficit, rising net services exports and increasing remittances.The Net services receipts increased from USD 143.3 billion during FY23 to USD 162.8 billion in FY24, primarily on account of rising exports of software, travel and business services. The remittances by Indians employed overseas, was USD 106.6 billion in FY24, against USD 101.8 billion during the previous year.Remittances to India are forecasted to grow at 3.7 per cent to USD 124 billion in 2024 and at 4 per cent to reach USD 129 billion in 2025, emphasized the Survey.CAPITAL ACCOUNT BALANCEEmphasizing about the stable capital inflows which continue to finance the CAD, the Survey mentioned that during FY24, net capital flows stood at USD 86.3 billion against USD 58.9 billion during the previous year, primarily driven by FPI flows and net inflows of banking capital.The Survey emphasized that India witnessed positive net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows in FY24 of USD 44.1 billion, supported by strong economic growth, a stable business environment, and increased investor confidence.Highlighting that India received the highest equity inflows among emerging market peers during FY24, the Survey listed financial services, automobile and auto components, healthcare, and capital goods were the significant sectors attracting equity inflows during FY24.The Survey noted that the Net FDI inflows to India declined from USD 42.0 billion during FY23 to USD 26.5 billion in FY24 as an impact of decline in global FDI flows. It further added that the gross FDI inflows moderated only by 0.6 per cent from USD 71.4 billion in FY23 to just under USD 71 billion in FY24.Highlighting that India has a well-established infrastructure to attract FDI in select sectors, i.e., Greenfield projects such as renewables, digital services such as telecommunications, software and hardware, and consultancy services, the Economic Survey suggested that where investment intentions are high, the sectors must be made more accessible for investments. It further added that the focus must remain on improving the ease of doing business across sectors and extend beyond sectors attractive to FDI alone by working out the details across all levels of government – national, state and local - and across regulators.The Survey listed that educated labour and a skilled workforce coupled with a vibrant R&D culture are important magnets to enhance sustained investor interest, apart from political stability, policy predictability and stability, reasonable duties and taxes, dispute resolution mechanisms and ease of repatriation.The Survey highlighted that during FY24, India’s Foreign Exchange Reserve (FER) increased by USD 68 billion, the highest increase among major foreign exchange reserves-holding countries. The Survey notes that the Rupee emerged as the least volatile currency among its emerging market peers and a few advanced economies in FY24. It further stated that Rising FPI inflows kept the Indian Rupee in a manageable range of ₹82 to ₹83.5/USD in FY24.The Economic Survey says that Indian residents’ overseas financial assets, by end of March 2024, was at USD 1,028.3 billion were higher by USD 109.7 billion or 11.9 per cent compared to the level as of March 2023. The factors attributed were mainly due to a rise in reserve assets, currency and deposits, overseas direct investment, trade credit and advances and loans.  EXTERNAL DEBT The External debt to GDP ratio declined to 18.7 per cent at the end of March 2024 from 19.0 per cent at the end of March 2023. Survey added that comparing various debt vulnerability indicators of India with peer countries for 2022 indicates that India is in a better position with relatively low levels of total debt as a percentage of Gross National Income (GNI) and short-term external debt as a percentage of total external debt.The Economy survey noted that India’s trade deficit is expected to decline further as the PLI scheme is expanded and India creates a globally competitive manufacturing base in several product categories. It added that the recently signed FTAs are expected to increase the global market share of the country’s exports. The Survey mentioned that various international agencies and RBI expect the CAD to GDP to moderate to below one per cent for FY24, driven by growing merchandise and services exports and resilient remittances.The Survey listed the fall in demand from major trading partners, Rise in trade cost, Commodity price volatility, Trade policy changes as some of the major challenges to India’s balance of trade. The Survey suggested that the changing composition of India’s export basket, enhancement in trade-related infrastructure, enhanced quality consciousness and product safety considerations in the private sector and stable policy environment are expected to play a significant role in driving India’s rise as a global supplier of goods and services.NB/AD/VM/SR/AG","India's external sector remained strong despite ongoing geopolitical headwinds, with services exports continuing to perform well. The overall trade deficit decreased from USD 121.6 billion in FY23 to USD 78.1 billion in FY24.

GOVERNMENTS PRUDENT MONETARY & TRADE POLICY SUPPORTED BY STRONG OUTPUT GROWTH REDUCES RETAIL INFLATION TO A FOUR-YEAR LOW OF 5.4% IN FY24,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034947,"The Economic Survey 2023-24, that was tabled in Parliament today, lays special emphasis on controlling Prices and Inflation as 'Low and stable inflation is key to sustaining economic growth.' It states that Governments and Central Banks face the challenge of keeping inflation at a moderate level while ensuring financial stability. Achieving this delicate balance requires careful monitoring of economic indicators and taking appropriate and timely corrective actions. With the commitment of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the goal of price stability and policy actions by the Central Government, India has successfully managed to keep retail inflation at 5.4 per cent in FY24, the lowest level in 4 years, since the Covid-19 pandemic period.The Economic Survey highlights the fact that India's retail inflation is lower than the emerging markets & developing economies (EMDES) and world average in 2022 and 2023 as per IMF data. Survey states that factors such as established monetary policies, economic stability, well-developed and efficient markets that balance supply and demand conditions, and stable currencies contribute to the effective management of inflation. Historically, inflation in advanced economies has generally been lower than in EMDEs.Inflation ManagementWith the goal of maintaining price stability, many countries have established their own inflation targets based on various factors that serve their economic objectives best. Lauding India's Inflation Management, the Economic Survey states that interestingly, India is performing better than various developed and emerging economies in relation to its inflation target. In 2023, India's inflation rate was within its target range of 2 to 6 per cent. Compared to advanced economies like the USA, Germany, and France, India had one of the lowest deviations from its inflation target in the triennial average inflation from 2021-2023. Despite the challenges posed by global demand- supply imbalances due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, India's inflation rate was 1.4 percentage points below the global average in 2023. Since 2020, countries have been facing challenges in controlling inflation. India has been able to bring about a declining trend in Headline and Core Inflation through its prudent administrative measures and monetary policy. As per the Economic Survey, since May 2022, monetary policy broadly focused on absorbing excess liquidity in the system by increasing the policy repo rate by 250 basis points from 4 per cent in May 2022 to 6.5 per cent in February, 2023. Thereafter, the policy rate was kept unchanged by focusing on the gradual withdrawal of accommodation, aiming to align inflation with the target, while simultaneously fostering growth. Consequently, the persistent and sticky core inflation observed in FY23 declined to 3.1 per cent in June, 2024The Survey further asserts that administrative measures such as price cuts for LPG, petrol, and diesel led to lower LPG and petroleum product inflation. LPG inflation rate has been in the deflationary zone since September 2023 while retail inflation in petrol and diesel moved to the deflationary zone in March 2024. Additionally, global commodity prices declined in 2023, reducing price pressure in energy, metals, minerals, and agricultural commodities through the imported inflation channel. Low fuel and core inflation ensured a downward trajectory for headline inflation, despite volatility in food prices in FY24. As per the recent data released by MoSPI, the retail inflation rate was 5.1 per cent in June 2024.Core inflation, measured by excluding food and energy items from CPI headline inflation has witnessed a four year low in FY24. From the pandemic-driven highs, inflationary pressures in India eased in FY22, aided by softening food inflation. Inflationary pressures firmed up in FY23 yet again driven by the Russia-Ukraine war disrupting the recouping supply chains leading to a rise in food and fuel prices. In FY24, the price situation improved. CPI inflation moderated, driven by a decline in core inflation in both goods and services. Core services inflation eased to a nine-year low in FY24; at the same time, core goods inflation also declined to a four-year low.Trends in core inflation are important in determining the contours of monetary policy. Assessing the emerging patterns of price pressures, the RBI increased the repo rate gradually by 250 basis points since May 2022 to curtail inflationary pressures, leading to reduction of around 4 percentage points in core inflation between April 2022 and June 2024. This was aided by moderation in housing rental inflation, with a significant increase in the stock of new houses in 2023.Food Inflation has been a global phenomenon in the last two years. Research indicates the rising vulnerability of food prices to climate change. In FY23 and FY24, the agriculture sector was affected by extreme weather events, lower reservoir levels, and damaged crops that adversely affected farm output and food prices. So, food inflation based on the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) increased from 3.8 per cent in FY22 to 6.6 per cent in FY23 and further to 7.5 per cent in FY24. However, the government took prompt actions, including open market sales, retailing in specified outlets, and timely imports, to ensure an adequate supply of essential food items. Additionally, to ensure food security for the poor, the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, which provides free food grains to more than 81 crore beneficiaries, was extended for a period of five years starting from January 2024.Global Food Prices and Domestic InflationGlobal food prices also have an impact on domestic inflation. In India, the edible oil market is heavily depends on imports, with more than 50 per cent of the total edible oil requirement being imported, making it sensitive to global prices. The Government closely monitors global market trends to ensure the availability of edible oils for consumers at an affordable price. Efforts are also made to balance imports with domestic production to mitigate the risks associated with global price volatility. In this context, the National Mission on Edible Oils Oil Palm aims to increase domestic crude palm oil production to reduce the import burden. In the case of sugar, the Government announced restrictions on export in June 2022 to ensure sufficient local supplies and thereby manage sugar inflation. These export restrictions have indeed played a role in stabilising domestic sugar prices. As a result, even though the global sugar price index inflated and has been showing volatility since February 2023, domestic sugar prices have remained much less volatile.Elaborating on the Interstate variations in Retail Inflation, the Economic Survey asserts that inflation rate was less than 6 per cent in 29 out of the 36 States and Union Territories. These Interstate variations in inflation are more pronounced in rural areas since rural consumption basket has a much higher weightage of food items (47.3%) than the urban (29.6%). Hence, in the last two years, States that witnessed elevated food prices also experienced higher rural inflation.Future Inflation ProjectionsRBI and IMF have projected India's consumer price inflation will progressively align towards the inflation target in FY26. Assuming a normal monsoon and no further external or policy shocks, the RBI expects headline inflation to be 4.5 per cent in FY25 and 4.1 per cent in FY26. IMF has projected an inflation rate of 4.6 per cent in 2024 and 4.2 per cent in 2025 for India. The World Bank expects that the global supply of commodities will increase, and so will their demand due to improved industrial activity and trade growth. It projects a 3 per cent decline in the commodity price index in 2024 and a 4 per cent decrease in 2025, mainly driven by lower energy, food and fertiliser prices. The energy price index is expected to reduce due to significant declines in coal and natural gas prices this year. Fertiliser prices are likely to weaken but remain above 2015-2019 levels due to strong demand and export restrictions. Base metal prices are projected to rise, reflecting increased global industrial activity and clean energy production. In general, the current downward movement in the prices of commodities imported by India is a positive for the domestic inflation outlook.1.

INDIAN AGRICULTURE SECTOR IS A SUCCESS STORY: ECONOMIC SURVEY 2023-24,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034946,"The Indian agriculture sector is a success story. The country has come a long way from being a food deficit and importing country in the 1960’s to being a net exporter of agricultural products, highlights The Economic Survey 2023-24, tabled  by the Union Finance and Corporate Minister Smt Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today.The need of the hour is to move from basic food security to nutritional security , points out the Survey. The Survey further notes that, we need more pulses, millet, fruits and vegetables, milk, meat and their demand is growing faster than that of basic staples. So, farm sector policies should align more with a ‘demand-driven food system’ that is more nutritious and aligned with Nature’s resource endowments, suggests the Survey.The Economic Survey elaborates five policy recommendations that governments can take to ensure that the markets function in the interest of the farmer. The first step talks about not banning futures or options at the first sign of price spikes. The intelligent regulatory design of such markets can obviate the need for bureaucratic interference in the futures market for agricultural commodities, adds the Survey. The second recommendation by the Survey talks about invoking export bans only under exceptional circumstances and allowing domestic consumers to substitute, especially if the agricultural commodities in question are not essential consumption items such as foodgrains. “Farmers should be allowed to benefit from higher international prices”, states the Survey.As the third step, the Survey talks about re-examining the inflation-targeting framework. It says that India’s inflation targeting framework should consider targeting inflation, excluding food. “Higher food prices are, more often, not demand-induced but supply-induced. It is worth exploring whether India’s inflation targeting framework should target the inflation rate excluding food”, notes the Survey. The Survey further notes that hardships caused by higher food prices for poor and low-income consumers can be handled through direct benefit transfers or coupons for specified purchases valid for appropriate durationsThe fourth recommendation talks about the need for increasing the Total Net Irrigated Area. Several states are well below the national average and India’s irrigation efficiency is only 30-40 percent for surface water and 50-60 per cent for groundwater, points out the Survey. The Survey highlights the need for better water utilisation farming practices and technologies like drip and fertigation.The fifth and final suggestion by the Survey is about making farming consistent with climate considerations. Grains such as rice and sugarcane are water-guzzling crops and cultivation of paddy gives rise to methane emissions. The time has come to promote crop-neutral incentive structures, says the Survey.Agriculture is at the confluence of three of the greatest challenges of the 21st century – sustaining food and nutrition security, adaptation and mitigation of climate change, and sustainable use of critical resources such as water, energy, and land, highlights the Survey. The Survey notes that although agriculture and allied sectors hold significant potential for gainful employment, India is yet to fully exploit the potential of agriculture to contribute to economic growth and employment generation.The agricultural sector requires a serious structural transformation due to challenges posed by water scarcity and climate change adds the Survey.  The surge in agricultural employment in COVID years due to reverse migration, the decline in the growth rate of value addition in agriculture in FY24, and an extremely hot summer in the Northwestern and central regions of the country in the summer of 2024 with rising water stress and energy consumption make a serious and honest stock-taking of India’s farm sector policies imperative, concludes the Survey.The Indian agriculture sector is a success story.

GROSS CAPITAL FORMATION (GCF) OF AGRICULTURE SECTOR GROWS AT THE RATE OF 19.04 PER CENT IN 2022-23: ECONOMIC SURVEY,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034945,"Economic Survey 2023-24 was presented in the Parliament today by Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman. The Economic Survey states that the Gross Capital Formation (GCF) of the agriculture sector and the share of GCF in the agriculture and allied sectors as a percentage of Gross Value Added (GVA) has been growing steadily, mainly due to increased public investment. The GCF of the agriculture sector grew at the rate of 19.04 per cent in 2022-23, and the GCF as a percentage of GVA rose from 17.7 per cent in 2021-22 to 19.9 per cent in 2022-23, suggesting an increase in investment in agriculture. The average annual growth in GCF from 2016-17 to 2022-23 was 9.70 percent. The Survey states that despite the increasing trend in GCF, there is a need to further boost agriculture investment, especially in the context of doubling farmers’ income. The DFI 2016 report indicated that to double farmers’ income over the period of 2016-17 to 2022-23, income would need to grow at an annual rate of 10.4 per cent in the farm sector, which in turn would require an annual growth rate in agriculture investment of 12.5 percent. The government’s priority has been to provide timely, cost-effective, and adequate credit that reduces the dependence on non-institutional credit and increases investment. The measures have reduced the share of non-institutional credit from 90 per cent in 1950 to 23.40 per cent in 2021-22. As of 31 January 2024, the total credit disbursed to agriculture amounted to ₹ 22.84 lakh Crore, with ₹13.67 lakh Crore allocated to crop loans (short term) and ₹ 9.17 lakh Crore to term loans.Kisan Credit Card(KCC):The Economic Survey states that the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) has streamlined agricultural credit accessibility and as of January 31, 2024, banks issued 7.5 crores KCC with a limit of ₹9.4 lakh crores. As a further measure, the KCC was extended to meet the working capital needs of fisheries and animal husbandry activities in 2018-19, along with the enhancement of the limit for collateral-free loans to ₹1.6 lakh. In the case of a Tri-Partite Agreement (TPA) among borrowers, milk unions, & banks, the collateral-free loan can go up to ₹3 lakh As of March 31, 2024, 3.49 lakh KCC and 34.5 lakh KCC were issued to fisheries and animal husbandry activities, respectively. Economic Survey states that  Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) have emerged as an essential source of credit for tenant farmers. JLG accounts have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 43.76 per cent over the past five years, emerging as a vital source in meeting the credit needs of tenant farmers and  marginalised segments.Agriculture Infrastructure:Economic Survey shows that as of 30th April 2024, 48357 projects were sanctioned for storage infrastructure with ₹4570 Crore released as subsidy, and 20878 other projects are also under progress with ₹2084 Crore released as subsidy. To give further fillip to farm gate infrastructure and also involve the private sector more actively, the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) was launched with a financing facility of ₹1 lakh Crore to be disbursed between FY 2020-21 to FY 2025-26 with support extending till FY 2032-33. The Economic Survey states that the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund(AIF)  provides medium-term debt financing for post-harvest management and community farming projects, offering interest subvention and credit guarantee support. As of 5th July 2024, AIF mobilised an investment of ₹73194 Crore, supporting 17196 custom hiring centres, 14868 primary processing units, 13165 warehouses, 2942 sorting and grading units,1792 cold storage projects, and 18981 other projects. In addition, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana (PMKSY) introduced credit-linked financial assistance through grants-in-aid to build efficient supply chain management from farm to retail to reduce the wastage of perishable produce and extend food shelf life. Under PMKSY 1044 projects were completed till end March 2024.

AGRICULTURE SECTOR HAS REGISTERED AN AVERAGE ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 4.18 PER CENT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS : ECONOMIC SURVEY ,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034943,"Economic Survey 2023-24 presented in the Parliament today by Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman. Economic Survey says that smallholder farmers need to move to high-value agriculture. The Survey says once the incomes of smallholders increases, they will demand manufactured goods, spurring a  manufacturing revolution. Economic Survey states that the Investment in agriculture research and support of enabling policies have contributed substantially to food security. It is estimated that for every rupee invested in agricultural research (including education), there is a payoff of ₹13.85. In 2022-23, ₹19.65 Thousand Crore was spent on agriculture research. Economic Survey calls for enhancing private sector investment in agriculture saying it is vital to provide impetus to the agriculture sector. Investment in technology, production methods, marketing infrastructure, and reduction in post-harvest losses need to be scaled up. A greater focus on post-harvest infrastructure and the development of the food processing sector can reduce wastage/loss and increase the length of storage, ensuring better prices for the farmers. Economic Survey says that in 2022-23, foodgrain production hit an all-time high of 329.7 million tonnes, and oilseeds production reached 41.4 million tonnes. In 2023-24, food grain production is slightly lower at 328.8 million tonnes, primarily because of poor and delayed monsoons. The domestic availability of edible oil has risen from 86.30 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to 121.33 lakh tonnes in 2023-24. The total area coverage of all oilseeds has increased from 25.60 million hectares in 2014-15 to 30.08 million hectares in 2023-24(17.5 percent growth). This has reduced the percentage share of imported edible oil, from 63.2 per cent in 2015-16 to 57.3 percent in 2022-23, despite rising domestic demand and consumption patterns. Economic Survey suggests that to promote efficiency in agriculture marketing, and improve price discovery, the government implemented the e-NAM Scheme and as of 14th March 2024, more than 1.77 Crore farmers and 2.56 Lakh traders have been registered on the e-NAM portal. The Government of India launched the scheme to form and promote 10,000 FPOs in 2020 with a budget outlay of ₹6.86 thousand crore till 2027-28. As of 29 February 2024, 8,195 FPOs have registered under the new FPO scheme, and equity grants of ₹157.4 crore were released to 3,325 FPOs. Credit guarantee cover worth ₹278.2 crore was issued to 1,185 FPOs.Economic Survey shows that to provide social security to the most vulnerable farmer families, the Government implements Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY).

NEP 2020 PREPARES YOUTH TO TAKE ON CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES EMERGING FROM A KNOWLEDGE-DRIVEN ECONOMY OF 21ST CENTURY,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034927,"The National Education Policy (NEP), launched in 2020 is a policy document that not only encompasses the SDG Goals on education but also prepares the youth of India to take on the challenges and opportunities emerging from a knowledge-driven economy of the 21st century, says the Economic Survey 2023-24 tabled in Parliament today by the Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Smt Nirmala Sitharaman. The Survey states that the school education system in India, with public and private schools, caters to around 26 crore students from various socio-economic backgrounds and the NEP 2020 seeks to provide all learners in the age group of 3-18 years with access to high-quality education to create an educational system that is rooted in Indian culture and has the potential to establish India as a global knowledge superpower.‘Poshan bhi Padhai bhi’The Survey mentions that in alignment with the guidelines of the National Education Policy 2020, ‘Poshan bhi Padhai bhi’ (PBPB) was launched in May 2023. It is a path-breaking Early Chilhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme to help India develop the world’s largest, universal, high-quality preschool network at Anganwadi Centres. The Survey highlighted that for the first time, early stimulation for 0-3 years is being covered by a Government programme. Through the programme, every child would be provided with at least two hours of high quality preschool instruction daily. All States will follow the national ECCE task force recommendations for a play-based, activity-based learning pedagogy explicitly targeted at developmental milestones of 0-3-year-olds and 3-6-year-olds, including special support for Divyang children, the Survey adds.Strengthening the country-wide-web of AnganwadisThe Survey stresses that considering global evidence that 85 per cent of brain development is achieved by the age of 6 years, the Anganwadi eco-system becomes a critical access point for building our children’s base to secure their future. In order to realise PBPB through Anganwadis, the latter will have to be strengthened with high-quality infrastructure, play equipment, and well-trained Anganwadi workers/teachers. In this regard, all Anganwadi Workers are to be trained on ECCE principles, including using activities, play and indigenous and DIY toys, through 40,000 Master Trainers. It also states that as of January 2024, 3735 State Level Master Trainers have been trained through 95 training programmes, covering 25 States and 182 Districts.Some major schemes/initiatives of the Government in school education that are driving the NEP 2020 goals and policies into action and their progress:The Vidyanjali initiative has played a crucial role in enhancing the educational experiences of over 1.44 crore students by facilitating comprehensive community engagement and leveraging volunteer contributions across various domains, including subject assistance and mentoring and the provision of modern electronics and digital devices. Progress in School InfrastructureReporting on the basic facilities in all schools the Survey notes that there are 97% girls toilets in 2022-23 as compared to 88.1% in 2012-13.

"TOTAL ENROLMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION INCREASES TO NEARLY 4.33 CRORE IN FY22 FROM 3.42 CRORE IN FY15, AN INCREASE OF 26.5 % SINCE FY15",https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034925,"The higher education sector, comprising tertiary and post-school learning in universities and other institutions, has witnessed acceleration in total enrolment coupled with rising ‘enrolment equity’ over the past eight years. As per All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) 2021-22, total enrolment in higher education has increased to nearly 4.33 crore in FY22 from 4.14 crore in FY21 and 3.42 crore in FY15 (an increase of 26.5 per cent since FY15), said the Economic Survey 2023-24 tabled in Parliament today by the Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman. Rising equity in higher educationThe Survey mentioned that the rise in enrolment in higher education has been driven by underprivileged sections such as SC, ST and OBC, with a faster growth in female enrolment across sections. Female enrolment in higher education increased to 2.07 crore in FY22 from 1.57 crore in FY15, i.e. a 31.6 per cent increase. The growing equity in higher education implies better employment opportunities for the hitherto backward sections.Re-imagining lifelong learning through a digital prismThe Survey mentioned that India has 26.52 crore students in school, 4.33 crore in higher education and more than 11 crore learners in skilling institutions. The vast expanse of the educational landscape comprises 14.89 lakh schools, 1.50 lakh secondary schools, 1.42 lakh higher secondary schools, 1,168 Universities, 45,473 colleges, 12,002 standalone institutions, 94.8 lakh teachers in school education and 15.98 lakh teachers in higher education.The National Credit Framework (NCrF), announced under National Education Policy 2020 in April 2023, forms the bulwark of the regulatory architecture underpinning life-long learning. Bolstering the regulatory architecture is an extensive array of digital solutions, such as digital public infrastructure (DPI), which act as force multipliers. Prime among India’s educational DPIs is APAAR, i.e. Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry, which serves as an electronic registry for institutions, students, and faculty by creating unique identities and lifelong academic credentials for each stakeholder in the education space. APAAR is supplemented by the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC), an online repository of academic credits that facilitates students’ mobility across Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) through a formal process of credit recognition, accumulation, transfer and redemption. Once an APAAR ID is created, HEIs map the credits a student earns to their ID, with all such credits stored in the ABC in demat form.The twin solution of APAAR and ABC, by allowing real-time verification of identity and academic credentials, paves the way for several interesting use cases. These include the possibility of students pursuing credit courses from different institutions for a particular qualification (now a reality) or targeting scholarships/ internships/ educational loans using academic profiles. As of July 2024, 2037 HEIs have onboarded ABC, and 30.13 crore APAAR IDs have been created for students of higher education, school education and skill institutes.Way forward in educationThe Survey highlighted that as education is one of the most critical areas for India’s development, mission-mode and cost-effective implementation of well-designed and well-intentioned programmes is essential to improve the quality of education, especially primary education, without which further years of education add little value. To realise the same, unity of purpose and convergence of efforts across the centre, state, and local Governments is called for, as ‘public education’ is a concurrent list subject.Increasing the cost-effectiveness of public spending on education requires spending on pedagogy and governance. This can include filling supervisory positions to monitor teaching quality, recognition of good and bad teacher performance, and hiring of local volunteers to ensure ‘teaching at the right level’ as textbook completion means little if children are way behind curricular standards.India making headway in R&DThe Survey highlighted that India is making rapid progress in R&D, with nearly 1,00,000 patents granted in FY24, compared to less than 25,000 patent grants in FY20.According to WIPO, India saw the highest growth (31.6 %) in patent filings in 2022. India has consistently improved its rank in the Global Innovation Index (GII) from 81st position in 2015 to 40th in 2023, as per GII (2023).On the human resource side, total Ph.D. enrolment in India has increased to 81.2 per cent in FY22 (2.13 lakh) from FY15 (1.17 lakh). The Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) in the country has been consistently increasing over the years and has more than doubled from ₹60,196.8 crore in FY11 to ₹ 127,381 crore in FY21 As a mark of India’s ascent in high-quality research, the country climbed up to 9th rank in the Nature’s Index 2023, overtaking Australia and Switzerland. India’s share of high-quality research articles (measured in terms of absolute numbers and not percentages) increased by 44 per cent in the past four years, i.e., from 1039.7 in 2019 to 1494.7 in 2023.The Government has recently decided to increase the scholarships for students pursuing PhD and Post-Doctoral research. Further, India has launched its own National Research Foundation called ‘Anusandhan’ operationalised by the Department of Science and Technology (under the Anusandhan National Research Foundation Act, 2023 Act). This foundation will act as an apex body that aims to strengthen and promote the R&D ecosystem. In the interim budget of FY25, the Government also announced a corpus of Rs. 1 lakh crore for research and innovation in the country, adopting the slogan “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan, Jai Anusandhan”.The higher education sector, comprising tertiary and post-school learning in universities and other institutions, has witnessed acceleration in total enrolment coupled with rising ‘enrolment equity’ over the past eight years.

NEW SKILLING INITIATIVES AND REVAMPING THE EXISTING ONES SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE OF HIGH PRIORITY TO THE GOVERNMENT–ECONOMIC SURVEY 2023-24,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034924,"India’s education policies and skill policies should adopt a laser-like focus on learning and skilling outcomes and need to be aligned with each other, as well. This is one of the six major pillars for realizing the collective goal of ViksitBharat@2047 in the medium term, as stated in the Economic Survey 2023-24, tabled by Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today. Terming that the NEP (New Education Policy) 2020 provides a good framework to realise this objective, the Survey says new skilling initiatives and revamping the existing skilling initiatives should continue to be of high priority to the Government.Skills are acquired on the foundations built by the education system, especially at the schools. Therefore, schooling should focus on the basic requirement of foundational literacy and numeracy and the realisation of grade-appropriate learning outcomes, adds the Survey. The Survey also calls upon the industry to take lead in skill creation saying it has much to gain from taking the initiative with academic institutions rather than leaving it only up to the governments to do the heavy lifting. Indeed, it should be the other way around, says the Survey.The Economic Survey 2023-24 states that the government is taking measures to create the job and entrepreneurial opportunities that are in sync with the aspirations and abilities of India’s youth. Highlighting the significant improvement in the proportion of skilled people across all socio-economic classifications, the Survey mentions that 4.4 per cent of the youth in the age cohort of 15-29 years have received formal vocational/technical training, while another 16.6 per cent received training through informal sources. The Economic Survey says that the skill development is at the centre of changes happening in education and labour markets amid the global megatrends, such as automation, action against climate change, the digitalisation of products and services, which are changing the nature of work and skills demands. It says that with one of the youngest populations, a median age of 28, India can harness its demographic dividend by nurturing a workforce that is equipped with employable skills and prepared for the needs of the industry.The Survey mentions that India has not only recognised the potential of its young workforce but also the issues associated with skilling such a vast population. It says the National Policy on Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (NPSDE) focuses on bridging gaps, improving industry engagement, establishing a quality assurance framework, leveraging technology, and expanding apprenticeship opportunities. This, in combination with the National Education Policy (NEP), holds tremendous potential for bridging the education-employment gap in India, adds the Survey.The Survey mentions that sixty-five per cent of India’s fast-growing population is under 35, and estimates show that about 51.25 per cent of the youth is deemed employable. However, it must be noted that the percentage has improved from around 34 per cent to 51.3 per cent in the last decade, the Survey adds.Noting that productive jobs are vital for growth and inclusion, the survey says India’s workforce is estimated to be nearly 56.5 Crore and will continue to grow until 2044. It estimates that the Indian economy needs to generate nearly 78.51 lakh jobs annually in the non-farm sector to cater to the rising workforce. However, to create these many jobs, there is a need to create the conditions for faster growth of productive jobs outside of agriculture, especially in organized manufacturing and services, even while improving productivity in agriculture, the Survey adds.The Survey calls for maximizing the outcomes from various skilling initiatives through convergence, and utilization of synergies with other employment-centric programmes which can further mutually benefit the two verticals. Linking skill development with Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and employment-linked incentive schemes in high growth potential sectors like toy, apparel, tourism, logistics, textiles, leather sector etc. would aid upgrading of skills as production moves up the value chain. On the apprenticeship promotion front also, there remains considerable scope to add flexibility to the regulatory framework, the Survey noted.NB/SK/VM/India’s education policies and skill policies should adopt a laser-like focus on learning and skilling outcomes and need to be aligned with each other, as well. This is one of the six major pillars for realizing the collective goal of ViksitBharat@2047 in the medium term, as stated in the Economic Survey 2023-24, tabled by Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today. Terming that the NEP (New Education Policy) 2020 provides a good framework to realise this objective, the Survey says new skilling initiatives and revamping the existing skilling initiatives should continue to be of high priority to the Government.Skills are acquired on the foundations built by the education system, especially at the schools. Therefore, schooling should focus on the basic requirement of foundational literacy and numeracy and the realisation of grade-appropriate learning outcomes, adds the Survey. The Survey also calls upon the industry to take lead in skill creation saying it has much to gain from taking the initiative with academic institutions rather than leaving it only up to the governments to do the heavy lifting.

It says Licensing, Inspection, and Compliance requirements that MSMEs have to deal with, imposed particularly by sub-national governments, hold them back from growing to their potential and being job creators of substance. The Survey says threshold-based concessions and exemptions create the unintended effect of incentivising enterprises to cap their sizes below the thresholds and therefore, calls that threshold-based incentives must have sunset clauses.  Calling for deregulation as a vital policy contribution, the Survey says revival or creation of institutional mechanisms for dialogue with states on required policy changes is essential. It adds that much of the action has to happen at the level of sub-national (state and local) governments. MSME entrepreneurs also need training in critical areas of enterprise management, such as human resource management, financial management, and technology. The productivity of owner-entrepreneurs unleashed by such training will be immense, says the survey.   The Survey mentions that  MSMEs are the backbone of the Indian economy, contributing approximately 30 per cent of the country’s GDP, 45 per cent of manufacturing output, and providing employment to 11 crore of India’s population. It says the Government of India has been proactive in boosting the growth of the MSME sector, through initiatives such as the allocation of 5 lakh crore Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme for businesses, including MSMEs; equity infusion of 50,000 crore through the MSME Self-Reliant India Fund; New revised criteria for the classification of MSMEs; rollout of Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance programme with an outlay of 6,000 crores over 5 years; Launch of Udyam Assist Platform on 11.01.2023 to bring the Informal Micro Enterprises under the formal ambit for availing the benefit under Priority Sector Lending.

"DESPITE BEING ONE OF THE FASTEST-GROWING ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD, INDIA’S ANNUAL PER CAPITA CARBON EMISSION IS ONLY ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THE GLOBAL AVERAGE",https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034915,"Despite being one of the fastest-growing economies in the World, India’s annual per capita carbon emission is only about one-third of the global average, states Economic Survey 2023-24, which was tabled in Parliament today by Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman.Delving further into India’s achievements on addressing climate change, the Survey quoted a recent report by the International Finance Corporation, which highlighted that India is the only G20 nation in line with 2-degree centigrade warming. The survey further mentioned that the hallmark of India’s growth strategy is to manage the impact of climate change and at the same time give desired focus to developmental priorities.Significant Progress Made by India on Climate ActionIndia achieved most targets of the first NDC well in advance. Nation achieved 40 per cent cumulative electrical power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy sources in 2021 and reduced the emission intensity of India’s GDP from 2005 levels by 33 per cent in 2019– nine and eleven years before the target year of 2030, respectively.Further, as of 31 May 2024, the share of non-fossil sources in the installed electricity generation capacity has reached 45.4 per cent up from 32 per cent in April 2014. India is also on track to make an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3.0 billion tonnes through tree and forest cover by 2030, with a carbon sink of 1.97 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent having already been created from 2005 to 2019.India’s GDP between 2005 and 2019 has grown with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about seven per cent, whereas the emissions grew at a CAGR of about four per cent. i.e., the rate of emissions growth is lower than the rate of growth of our GDP. This shows that India has successfully decoupled its economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the emission intensity of its GDP. India’s total adaptation-relevant expenditure has increased from 3.7 per cent of GDP in 2015-16 to 5.60 per cent of the GDP in 2021-2022, indicating integration of climate resilience and adaptation into development plans.Low Carbon Development and Energy CompositionIndia’s energy needs are expected to grow 2 to 2.5 times by 2047 to meet a growing economy's developmental priorities and aspirations. Considering that resources are limited, the survey pointed out that the pace of energy transition would need to factor in alternative demands on the resources for improving resilience to climate change and for sustained social and economic development.Challenges for Energy Transition and Way ForwardHighlighting various challenges to India’s development of a low-carbon path, Economic Survey mentioned that expanding renewable energy and clean fuels will increase demand for land and water. Most renewables are land-intensive and demand the highest land use requirements among the different energy sources. Further, the expansion of renewable energy requires battery storage technologies which in turn require the availability of critical minerals and the source of such minerals is geographically concentrated.Recognising the importance of energy efficiency measures in accelerating clean energy transitions while supporting energy security, the Survey highlighted several initiatives taken by the Government to improve energy efficiency. Some of them include implementing Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) for buildings, Standards and Labelling (S&L) and Star-rated program for appliances, Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) initiative for encouraging the adoption of sustainable lifestyles, Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) scheme for industrial sector, and Charging Infrastructure for Electric Vehicles for transport sector, among others.All above mentioned initiatives translates to a total annual cost savings of approximately ₹1,94,320 Crore and an annual CO2 emissions reduction of around 306 million tonnes.Finance for Sustainable Development The Survey outlines that country has taken many measures to improve the business environment and catalyse greater quantum of resources. The Government undertook the issue of sovereign green bonds amounting to ₹16,000 Crore in January-February 2023 to raise proceeds for public sector projects that would contribute to the efforts to reduce the intensity of the economy's emissions, followed by ₹20,000 Crore raised through sovereign green bonds in October-December 2023. Further, RBI has implemented the Framework for Acceptance of Green Deposits for the Regulated Entities to foster and develop a green finance ecosystem in the country. In addition, the RBI promotes renewable energy through its Priority Sector Lending (PSL) rules.India's Innovative Green Credit ProgramThe Survey talks about the Government of India’s Mission LiFE, which is envisaged as a mass movement to address climate change and foster sustainable living based on conservation and moderation principles. It further states that to bolster LiFE’s effort and encourage eco-friendly practices, the Government also supports voluntary environmental actions such as the Green Credit Programme (GCP), which incentivises individuals, communities, private sector industries, and companies to participate in environment-positive activities by offering green credits as rewards.India leading International Initiatives Addressing Climate Change IssuesThe survey extensively talks about India leading several international initiatives towards climate change mitigation and building resilience.

"INDIA NEEDS TO LOOK AT CLIMATE CHANGE FROM THE ‘LOCAL LENS’, INSTEAD OF ‘ONE SIZE FITS ALL’ PRESCRIPTIONS FROM THE WEST",https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034914,"Taking a critical view of the Western approach of tackling Climate Change, the Economic Survey 2023-24 gives a clarion call to all developing countries to look at climate change problem from a ‘local lens’. It states that a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach will not work, and developing countries need to be free to choose their own pathways since they are tasked with balancing developmental goals with meaningful climate action. The Economic Survey 2023-24, tabled by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today, clearly states that current global strategies for climate change are flawed and not universally applicable. It states that adopting the practices of the West could prove to be disastrous for India where culture, economy, societal norms are already intertwined with the environment. The document highlights that India, despite making significant strides in climate action, often faces criticism for not aligning with Western solutions. This criticism stems from a lack of appreciation for India's unique social and cultural fabric, which is already rich with sustainable development ideas. It further goes on to point out inherent inconsistencies where the prescriptions to tackle Climate Change from the developed world do not hold ground globally. These are:The Economic Survey 2023-24 stresses that India’s ethos emphasizes a harmonious relationship with nature, in sharp contrast to the culture of overconsumption prevalent in other parts of the developed world, thus offering sustainable solutions to problems plaguing Western societies. For instance:In order to profess a solution to these issues, the Economic Survey brings in perspective Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of Mission LiFE. It embodies a ‘Lifestyle For Environment’ seeking to address the ‘wants’ of the people without letting them hurt Nature. The approach seeks to bring individual responsibility to the forefront of the fight against climate change, as sustenance is at the core of Indian ethos.The Mission encompasses a comprehensive but non-exhaustive list of 75 LiFE Actions for adoption by individuals to live more sustainably. At its heart, it promotes mindful consumption instead of overconsumption, encourages a circular economy and the reuse of waste products, eating local plant-based cuisines with a low ecological footprint, saving water and energy, notes the Survey.  The document quotes the International Energy Agency and states that adoption of the kinds of actions and measures targeted by the LiFE initiative worldwide would reduce annual global carbon di-oxide emissions by more than 2 billion tonnes in 2030 (20% of the emissions reductions needed by 2030) and in consumer savings of about USD 440 billion.In conclusion, the Survey document upholds the tenets of Mission ‘LiFE’ and notes that the global movement on climate change must be accommodative of sovereign choices and economic needs, but centered on individual behavior. ‘It’s time to rebuild societies with equanimity’, it adds.

New strain of lactic acid bacterium could be promising probiotic for food and pharmaceutical industry,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2034893,"Scientists have uncovered a new strain of lactic acid bacterium that could be a promising candidate for broader probiotic utilization beyond the dairy industry. The researchers from Agharkar Research Institute (ARI) Pune, an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology were keen to uncover the hidden potential of S. thermophilus often acclaimed for its role as a starter culture in various dairy products, through a collaborative genome analysis. A probe into the genetic makeup of strain MCC0200 revealed an arsenal of genes associated with gastrointestinal survival, intestinal adhesion, and health-promoting functionalities, painting a vivid picture of its probiotic prowess.One of the key challenges for any probiotic is surviving the treacherous journey through the human digestive system. In vitro studies revealed that MCC0200 not only withstands the harsh conditions of the gastrointestinal tract but also exhibits remarkable resilience against gastric juices and bile acids, which are the known crucial factors in determining probiotic efficacy. Delving deeper into its genome, the study published in the journal Microorganisms uncovered a repertoire of genes that can help acid tolerance and bile resistance, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underpinning its survival strategy. They found that MCC0200 which thrives in the gut, possesses a strong affinity for intestinal surfaces, allowing it to interact with host cells. This ability to adhere to mucosal surfaces is a crucial factor in promoting gut health and immune function. They also unravelled MCC0200's ability to auto aggregate and co-aggregate with pathogenic bacteria, a trait essential for competitive exclusion and gut colonization.Studies revealed MCC0200's antioxidative prowess, a quality that holds significant implications for gut health. With its ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species, MCC0200 emerged as a guardian of gut redox balance, offering protection against oxidative stress-induced damage. MCC0200 has also been revealed to be a nutrient powerhouse. Genome analysis uncovered the bacterium's biosynthetic capabilities, including the production of essential vitamins like folate (vitamin B9). Folate plays a crucial role in various cellular functions, and MCC0200's ability to synthesize this vital nutrient could have far-reaching implications for human health. This revelation underscores its potential as a nutritive supplement, offering valuable vitamins to individuals deficient in these vital nutrients.In the battle against cholesterol, MCC0200 emerges as a formidable ally. Studies demonstrated that this probiotic strain possesses the ability to assimilate cholesterol, potentially lowering serum cholesterol levels and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. While the exact mechanism is still under investigation, MCC0200's cholesterol-lowering properties hold promise as a functional food ingredient with cardiovascular benefits.As research into the health benefits of probiotics continues to evolve, Streptococcus thermophilus stands out as a beacon of hope for gut health with diverse health-promoting attributes. Its unique combination of probiotic properties, coupled with its safety profile, makes it a promising candidate for food and pharmaceutical applications. With further exploration and innovation, MCC0200 could pave the way for a healthier future for all.Publication link: https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms12020347For more details, please email:Dr. Prashant K.
