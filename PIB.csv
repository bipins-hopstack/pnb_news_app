Onion crop is harvested in three seasons: rabi in March-May; kharif in September-November and late kharif in January-February. In terms of production, rabi crop accounted for roughly 70% of the total production while kharif and late kharif together constitute 30%. Kharif onion plays important role in maintaining price stability during the lean months of between rabi and peak kharif arrivals.The target area under Kharif onion this year is 3.61 lakh hectare which is 27% higher than last year.

Further, dry weather condition prevailing during and after rabi harvest this year is observed to have helped in lowering storage loss of onion. Onion prices are stabilising as the quantity of rabi onion released in the market by farmers is increasing with higher mandi prices and onset of monsoon rains which increases the chances storage loss due to high atmospheric moisture.Though potato is essentially a Rabi crop, some quantities of Kharif potatoes are produced in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Meghalaya, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Kharif potato harvest during September to November augments the availability in the market. The area under Kharif potato this year is targeted to increase by 12% over last year. Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have covered almost the entire targeted sowing area while sowing in Karnataka and other States are in good progress. As per DAFW data, 273.2 lakh tonnes of Rabi potato had been stored in cold storage this year which is sufficient to meet the consumption demand.

DAY-NRLM is focused on promoting SHG women-led enterprises in manufacturing and service sectors covering farm and non-farm domains, creating a platform for social inclusion, financial services, and women's economic empowerment.","The Indian government has released guidelines for the second phase of its Green Hydrogen Mission, which aims to promote the production of green hydrogen through incentives. The capacity for this phase will be 450,000 tonnes per annum (TPA), with 40,000 TPA reserved for biomass-based pathways and the rest for technology-agnostic pathways. The Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) will oversee the implementation of this phase, and the Request for Selection (RfS) will be issued shortly. Bidders can apply for any or both categories, with a maximum capacity of 90,000 TPA for a single bidder. The National Green Hydrogen Campaign, launched in July 2024, aims to promote clean water and sanitation in rural areas, with a focus on preventing childhood mortality due to diarrhoea. The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DDWS) has launched an awareness campaign called 'Swachh Gaon, Shudh Jal- Behtar Kal' from July to August 2024, which aims to raise awareness and promote safe water and sanitation practices at the village and panchayat level. The Indian government has also launched a month-long campaign to address family pension grievances promptly and effectively for central government pensioners, as part of its 100-day action plan. The campaign aims to ease the lives of pensioners by resolving 1,891 family pension-related grievances identified in the pre-campaign phase, affecting 46 ministries, departments, and organizations, including those for defense, railways, and CAPFs under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare has also launched a similar campaign in January 2024 to address family pension grievances for central government pensioners. The Union Minister for Science and Technology, Dr Jitendra Singh, has launched the Indo-French Liver and Metabolic Disease Network (InFLiMeN) in New Delhi. The network aims to address non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which can lead to cirrhosis and primary liver cancer. The network involves 11 French and 17 Indian doctors and aims to promote biomarker discovery using a comprehensive omics approach. The Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) for the periods April, 2021 – March, 2022 (ASUSE 2021-22) and October, 2022 – September, 2023 (ASUSE 2022-23) has been released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI). The survey covers all non-agricultural activities, excluding those covered under the Factories Act, 1948, and Shops and Establishments Act, 1956. The sampling scheme involves a two-stage stratified random sampling technique. The sample size for ASUSE 2021-22 was 1,22,000 establishments, and for ASUSE 2022-23, it was 1,44,000 establishments. Data was collected through personal visits by trained interviewers. Key findings from the surveys include:

- The total number of establishments in the sector increased by 5.88% annually from April, 2021 – March, 2022 to October, 2022 – September, 2023.

Union Minister Dr. Jitendra Singh launched Indo-French Liver and Metabolic Disease Network (InFLiMeN) a virtual node to prevent and cure metabolic liver diseases at Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences today in New Delhi.Addressing the launch programme Dr. Jitendra Singh highlighted that the Indo-French Node, InFLiMeN, aims to address key issues related to a common metabolic liver disorder, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which can progress to cirrhosis and primary liver cancer eventually. It predates diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and many other diseases.

While in the West, most NAFLD is associated with obesity, intriguingly in the Indian subcontinent, NAFLD occurs in about 20% of non-obese patients.Emphasizing the vitality of this initiative, the science and technology minister said, “There is a considerable burden of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) in India and France.” He further added that both NAFLD and ALD exhibit a very similar progression from steatosis to steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC.Highlighting India's progress in the last decade in the health sector, Dr. Jitendra Singh said, “India became a global leader not just in curative healthcare but also in preventive healthcare.”. There is an urgent need to develop simple, low-cost diagnostic tests for the detection of different stages of fatty liver and their progression to severe, full-blown diseases. The approaches and algorithms should suit the Indian context, low-priced, and have a point of care.Dr. Jitendra Singh advised that a joint multi-disciplinary collaborative program like InFLiMeN is urgently needed to understand the development, progression and possible management of liver diseases using a comprehensive omics approach for biomarker discovery.Emphasizing on the co-operation and collaboration of both the Government and Private sector to provide best services to citizens and promote ease of healthy living. He also highlighted the government’s initiatives and policies aimed at supporting and improving the healthcare system.
