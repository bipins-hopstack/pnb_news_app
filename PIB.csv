PRESIDENT OF INDIA SPENDS SOME TIME AT SEA BEACH OF PURI,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2031467,"The President of India, Smt Droupadi Murmu spent some time this morning (July 8, 2024) at the sea beach of the holy city of Puri, a day after participating in the annual Rath Yatra. Later she penned her thoughts about the experience of being in close commune with nature.Here is the text that was posted on X: “There are places that bring us in closer touch with the essence of life and remind us that we are part of nature. Mountains, forests, rivers and seashores appeal to something deep within us. As I walked along the seashore today, I felt a communion with the surroundings – the gentle wind, the roar of the waves, and the immense expanse of water. It was a meditative experience.It brought to me a profound inner peace that I had also felt when I had a darshan of Mahaprabhu Shri Jagannathji yesterday. And I am not alone in having such an experience; all of us can feel that way when we encounter something that is far larger than us, that sustains us and that makes our lives meaningful.In the hustle and bustle of the daily grind, we lose this connection with Mother Nature. Humankind believes it has mastered nature and is exploiting it for its own short-term benefits. The result is for all to see. This summer, many parts of India suffered a terrible series of heatwaves. Extreme weather events have become more frequent around the globe in recent years. The situation is projected to be far worse in the decades to come.More than seventy percent of the surface of the earth is made up of oceans, and global warming is leading to a rise in global sea levels, threatening to submerge coastal areas. The oceans and the rich variety of flora and fauna found there have suffered heavily due to different kinds of pollution.Fortunately, people living in nature’s lap have sustained traditions that can show us the way. Inhabitants of coastal areas, for example, know the language of the winds and waves of the sea. Following our ancestors, they worship the sea as God.There are two ways, I believe, to meet the challenge of protection and conservation of the environment; broader steps that can come from governments and international organisations, and smaller, local steps that we can take as citizens. The two are, of course, complementary. Let us pledge to do what we can do – individually, locally – for the sake of a better tomorrow. We owe it to our children.” DS/SRThe President of India, Smt Droupadi Murmu spent some time this morning (July 8, 2024) at the sea beach of the holy city of Puri, a day after participating in the annual Rath Yatra.

Feature: Project PARI,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2031567,"Public art spaces of India are a reflection of our Lok Kala and Lok Sanskriti. When we talk about Public Art, it is very dynamic and is an intersection of past, present, and future. Through it, we can see the amalgamation of different ideas in various art forms like traditional and contemporary. This art form which is freely accessible to the public; attracts not only attention but even thoughts begin to gather as to why this work of art is here, what is its uniqueness, what material it is made up of, and what is the thought of the artist behind this artwork. Making it open to various interesting interpretations. These are the few aspects that make this art very special. It connects the public to the art.With rapid urbanization, Public Art enhances a sense of distinctiveness and adds aesthetic value to the image of a city. It contributes to the visual quality of the public arena encouraging community pride with a sense of belonging. It uplifts and engages visitors or passers-by’s travel experience by leaving an imprint in their minds. The outreach of Public Art is immense and thought-provoking. It acts as a significant factor in giving visual recognition to a specific place. The public art augments and induces meaning to a public space making it an integral part of the culture and society. The Ministry of Culture, Government of India, on the occasion of the 46th Session of the World Heritage Committee Meeting, which is being held in New Delhi from 21st-31st July 2024, has initiated Project PARI (Public Art of India). Under it, Lalit Kala Akademi, an autonomous institution under the Ministry of Culture, has invited more than 150 visual artists from all over the country. The Project PARI aims to provide a platform to uplift the aesthetic and cultural outlook of Delhi while adding grandeur to the rich historical legacy of our national capital.Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art seek to bring forth public art that draws inspiration from millennia of artistic heritage (lok kala/lok sanskriti) while incorporating modern themes and techniques. These expressions underscore the intrinsic value that art holds in Indian society, serving as a testament to the nation's enduring commitment to creativity and artistic expression. These artists are working on various sites in the national capital for the beautification of the public spaces for the upcoming event.  The representation of Art in public spaces is particularly significant as it showcases the nation's rich and diverse cultural heritage. The democratization of art through public installations transforms urban landscapes into accessible galleries, where art transcends the confines of traditional venues such as museums and galleries. By integrating art into streets, parks, and transit hubs, these initiatives ensure that artistic experiences are available to one and all. This inclusive approach fosters a shared cultural identity and enhances social cohesion, inviting citizens to engage with art in their day-to-day life. Project PARI aims to stimulate dialogue, reflection, and inspiration, contributing to the dynamic cultural fabric of the nation. Traditional art forms as well as sculptures, murals, and installations have been created under this beautification project. More than 150 visual artists from all over the country have come together to create the various wall paintings, murals, sculptures, and installations being prepared under this project. The creative canvas includes but is not limited to artwork inspired by and /or drawn in styles of Phad paintings (Rajasthan), Thangka painting (Sikkim/Ladakh), miniature painting (Himachal Pradesh), Gond art (Madhya Pradesh), Tanjore paintings (Tamil Nadu), Kalamkari (Andhra Pradesh), Alpona art (West Bengal), Cheriyal painting (Telangana), Pichhwai Painting (Rajasthan), Lanjia Saura (Odisha), Pattachitra (West Bengal), Bani Thani Painting (Rajasthan), Warli (Maharashtra), Pithora Art (Gujarat), Aipan (Uttarakhand), Kerala Murals (Kerala), Alpana art (Tripura) and more.The proposed sculptures being created for Project PARI include wide-ranging ideas such as paying tributes to nature, ideas inspired by the Natyashastra, Gandhi ji, toys of India, hospitality, ancient knowledge, Naad or Primeval Soun, Harmony of life, Kalpataru – the divine tree, etc. Furthermore, in sync with the proposed 46th World Heritage Committee Meeting, some of the artworks and sculptures draw inspiration from World Heritage Sites such as Bimbetka and the 7 natural World Heritage Sites in India find a special place in the proposed artworks.  Women artists have been an integral part of Project PARI and their participation in large numbers is a testimony of Bharat’s NARI SHAKTI. Project PARI stands as a monumental effort to infuse Delhi with the rich and diverse artistic heritage of India, while simultaneously embracing contemporary themes and expressions. As the city prepares to host the 46th session of the World Heritage Committee, the initiative not only beautifies public spaces but also democratizes art, making it accessible to all.

When we talk about Public Art, it is very dynamic and is an intersection of past, present, and future. Through it, we can see the amalgamation of different ideas in various art forms like traditional and contemporary. This art form which is freely accessible to the public; attracts not only attention but even thoughts begin to gather as to why this work of art is here, what is its uniqueness, what material it is made up of, and what is the thought of the artist behind this artwork. Making it open to various interesting interpretations. These are the few aspects that make this art very special. It connects the public to the art.With rapid urbanization, Public Art enhances a sense of distinctiveness and adds aesthetic value to the image of a city. It contributes to the visual quality of the public arena encouraging community pride with a sense of belonging. It uplifts and engages visitors or passers-by’s travel experience by leaving an imprint in their minds. The outreach of Public Art is immense and thought-provoking. It acts as a significant factor in giving visual recognition to a specific place. The public art augments and induces meaning to a public space making it an integral part of the culture and society. The Ministry of Culture, Government of India, on the occasion of the 46th Session of the World Heritage Committee Meeting, which is being held in New Delhi from 21st-31st July 2024, has initiated Project PARI (Public Art of India). Under it, Lalit Kala Akademi, an autonomous institution under the Ministry of Culture, has invited more than 150 visual artists from all over the country. The Project PARI aims to provide a platform to uplift the aesthetic and cultural outlook of Delhi while adding grandeur to the rich historical legacy of our national capital.Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art seek to bring forth public art that draws inspiration from millennia of artistic heritage (lok kala/lok sanskriti) while incorporating modern themes and techniques. These expressions underscore the intrinsic value that art holds in Indian society, serving as a testament to the nation's enduring commitment to creativity and artistic expression. These artists are working on various sites in the national capital for the beautification of the public spaces for the upcoming event.  The representation of Art in public spaces is particularly significant as it showcases the nation's rich and diverse cultural heritage. The democratization of art through public installations transforms urban landscapes into accessible galleries, where art transcends the confines of traditional venues such as museums and galleries. By integrating art into streets, parks, and transit hubs, these initiatives ensure that artistic experiences are available to one and all. This inclusive approach fosters a shared cultural identity and enhances social cohesion, inviting citizens to engage with art in their day-to-day life. Project PARI aims to stimulate dialogue, reflection, and inspiration, contributing to the dynamic cultural fabric of the nation. Traditional art forms as well as sculptures, murals, and installations have been created under this beautification project. More than 150 visual artists from all over the country have come together to create the various wall paintings, murals, sculptures, and installations being prepared under this project. The creative canvas includes but is not limited to artwork inspired by and /or drawn in styles of Phad paintings (Rajasthan), Thangka painting (Sikkim/Ladakh), miniature painting (Himachal Pradesh), Gond art (Madhya Pradesh), Tanjore paintings (Tamil Nadu), Kalamkari (Andhra Pradesh), Alpona art (West Bengal), Cheriyal painting (Telangana), Pichhwai Painting (Rajasthan), Lanjia Saura (Odisha), Pattachitra (West Bengal), Bani Thani Painting (Rajasthan), Warli (Maharashtra), Pithora Art (Gujarat), Aipan (Uttarakhand), Kerala Murals (Kerala), Alpana art (Tripura) and more.The proposed sculptures being created for Project PARI include wide-ranging ideas such as paying tributes to nature, ideas inspired by the Natyashastra, Gandhi ji, toys of India, hospitality, ancient knowledge, Naad or Primeval Soun, Harmony of life, Kalpataru – the divine tree, etc. Furthermore, in sync with the proposed 46th World Heritage Committee Meeting, some of the artworks and sculptures draw inspiration from World Heritage Sites such as Bimbetka and the 7 natural World Heritage Sites in India find a special place in the proposed artworks.  Women artists have been an integral part of Project PARI and their participation in large numbers is a testimony of Bharat’s NARI SHAKTI. Project PARI stands as a monumental effort to infuse Delhi with the rich and diverse artistic heritage of India, while simultaneously embracing contemporary themes and expressions. As the city prepares to host the 46th session of the World Heritage Committee, the initiative not only beautifies public spaces but also democratizes art, making it accessible to all.

Rebuttal to Citigroups Research Report on Employment in India,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2031529,"The recent research report by Citigroup on Employment in India quoted by some of the print and electronic media, which forecasts that India will struggle to create sufficient employment opportunities even with a 7% growth rate, fails to account for the comprehensive and positive employment data available from official sources such as the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) and the Reserve Bank of India's KLEMS data. Therefore, the Ministry of Labour and Employment strongly rebuts such reports which do not analyse all official data sources available in the public domain.Employment Data for IndiaAccording to PLFS and RBI's KLEMS data, India has generated more than 8 crore (80 million) employment opportunities from 2017-18 to 2021-22. This translates to an average of over 2 crore (20 million) employment per year, despite of the fact that the world economy was hit by COVID-19 pandemic during 2020-21 which contradicts Citigroup’s assertion of India’s inability to generate sufficient employment. This significant employment creation demonstrates the effectiveness of various government initiatives aimed at boosting employment across sectors.PLFS dataThe Annual PLFS report depicts an improving trend in labour market indicators related to: (i) Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR), (ii) Worker Population Ratio (WPR) and (iii) Unemployment Rate (UR) for persons of age 15 years and above during 2017-18 to 2022-23. For instance, the WPR i.e. employment has increased from 46.8% in 2017-18 to 56% in 2022-23. Similarly, the labour force participation has also increased in the country from 49.8% in 2017-18 to 57.9% in 2022-23. The Unemployment Rate has declined from 6.0 % in 2017-18 to a low of 3.2% in 2022-23.The PLFS data shows that during the last 5 years, more employment opportunities have been generated compared to the number of people joining the labour force, resulting in a consistent reduction in the unemployment rate. This is a clear indicator of the positive impact of government policies on employment. Contrary to the report, which suggests a dire employment scenario, the official data reveals a more optimistic picture of the Indian job market.EPFO DataThe formal sector employment figures are also being bolstered by government efforts to improve ease of doing business, enhance skill development, and provide incentives for job creation in both the public and private sectors. The EPFO data suggests that more and more workers are joining formal jobs. During 2023-24, more than 1.3 crore subscribers joined EPFO which is more than double compared to 61.12 lakh joined EPFO during 2018-19. Moreover, during last six and half years (since September, 2017 to March, 2024) more than 6.2 crore net subscribers have joined EPFO. New subscribers to NPSThe data from National Pension System (NPS) indicates that more than 7.75 lakh new subscribers have joined the NPS during 2023-24 under the Central and State governments which is 30% more than 5.94 lakh new subscribers joining NPS under government sector during 2022-23. This substantial increase in new subscribers highlights the government's proactive measures to fill-up the vacancies in public sector in timely manner. Flexi-staffing sector In a recent interaction of Indian Staffing Federation (ISF) members with Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment, ISF members informed that they are employing about 5.4 million formal contract workers. Nearly 30% demand in the sector remains unfulfilled at frontline across manufacturing, retail, banking due to talent shortages and labour mobility.  Multiple new opportunities The future prospects of the employment market in India are highly encouraging, as evidenced by data from various sources. The Global Capability Centers (GCCs) in India have shown remarkable growth in recent years. The gig economy also promises significant increase in workforce in the country. Notably, the NITI Aayog report on gig economy projects a substantial increase in platform workers, which is expected to reach 2.35 crore (23.5 million) by 2029-30, underscoring the rapid expansion of the gig economy. The gig workers are expected to form 6.7% of the non-agricultural workforce or 4.1% of the total livelihood in India by 2029-30. These developments collectively reflect India's robust economic trajectory and its potential to generate diverse employment opportunities.Data Credibility It is well known that the private data sources, which the report/media refers to as more reliable, has several shortcomings. These surveys use their own derived definition of employment – unemployment which is not aligned to either national or international standards. The sample distribution and methodology are often critiqued for not being as robust or representative as official data sources like PLFS. Therefore, reliance on such private data sources over official statistics can lead to misleading conclusions and thus, should be used with caution. Further, some authors use data selectively which undermines the credibility of their analysis and does not present an accurate picture of the employment scenario in India. Such reports fail to consider the positive trends and comprehensive data from official sources. Summary The official data sources like PLFS, RBI, EPFO, etc. show consistent improvements in the key labour market indicators, including increased Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) and Worker Population Ratio (WPR), and a declining Unemployment Rate during last five years. EPFO and NPS data further support the positive employment trends. The trends in manufacturing, expanding service sector, infrastructure growth, apart from others, including emerging opportunities in multiple sectors such as gig and platform economy and GCCs indicate robust future prospects. The Ministry of Labour and Employment emphasizes the credibility and comprehensiveness of official data, cautioning against the selective use of private data sources that can lead to misleading conclusions about India's employment scenario.The Government remains committed to creating a robust and inclusive job market, and the evidence suggests substantial progress is being made in this direction.Pragya Paliwal Gaur / Himanshu PathakThe recent research report by Citigroup on Employment in India quoted by some of the print and electronic media, which forecasts that India will struggle to create sufficient employment opportunities even with a 7% growth rate, fails to account for the comprehensive and positive employment data available from official sources such as the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) and the Reserve Bank of India's KLEMS data.
