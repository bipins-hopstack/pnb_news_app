Environmental impact of the Great Nicobar Project,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2036729,"The Central Government vide letter dated 27.10.2022 has accorded the In-principle/Stage-1 approval for diversion of 130.75 Sq km forest land for sustainable development in Great Nicobar Island. Compensatory Afforestation is carried out in lieu of diverted forest land. Further, more than 50% i.e. 65.99 Sq km of the area proposed for diversion is reserved for green development where no tree felling is envisaged. It is expected that about 15% of development area would continue to remain as green and open spaces and therefore the number of trees likely to be affected is going to be less than 9.64 lakhs. As per the conditions stipulated in the approvals accorded by the Central Government, adequate mitigation measures to compensate the impact of development on flora and fauna are part of the EC/FC conditions. The special conditions stipulated under the Environmental Clearance (EC) has provisions for preparation of Biodiversity Conservation / Management Plan for the Great Nicobar Island ecosystem with inputs from WII, ZSI, BSI and ICFRE.  The breeding grounds of leatherback turtles are in no way getting altered due to the project. The large nesting areas (Western flank) have been retained as such for nesting of leather backs.

Comprehensive studies and conservation measures for endemic Nicobar Megapod as prescribed by Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON) and WII is also one of the conditions of EC. The A&N Forest Department has been entrusted with this responsibility of ensuring implementation of the conservation measures.This information was given by the Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Kirti Vardhan Singh in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.The Central Government vide letter dated 27.10.2022 has accorded the In-principle/Stage-1 approval for diversion of 130.75 Sq km forest land for sustainable development in Great Nicobar Island. Compensatory Afforestation is carried out in lieu of diverted forest land. Further, more than 50% i.e. 65.99 Sq km of the area proposed for diversion is reserved for green development where no tree felling is envisaged. It is expected that about 15% of development area would continue to remain as green and open spaces and therefore the number of trees likely to be affected is going to be less than 9.64 lakhs. As per the conditions stipulated in the approvals accorded by the Central Government, adequate mitigation measures to compensate the impact of development on flora and fauna are part of the EC/FC conditions. The special conditions stipulated under the Environmental Clearance (EC) has provisions for preparation of Biodiversity Conservation / Management Plan for the Great Nicobar Island ecosystem with inputs from WII, ZSI, BSI and ICFRE.  The breeding grounds of leatherback turtles are in no way getting altered due to the project.

It highlights seven key programmes in areas such as adolescent health, education, child marriage prevention, and road safety, which are expected to yield impressive returns on investment. For every dollar invested, returns are estimated to range from USD 4.6 to USD 71.4.The report further demonstrates that future investments, some of which align with existing national programmes, have the potential to significantly boost the Indian economy. An investment of USD 33 billion per annum across various sectors by the government, private sector, civil society, communities, and families is projected to yield returns of USD 476 billion per annum, enhancing the GDP by an average of approximately 10.1%.

EXPANSION OF THERMAL POWER CAPACITY,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2037006,"In order to meet the estimated electricity demand by the year 2031-32, generation planning studies have been carried out by Central Electricity Authority (CEA). As per the study results, it is envisaged that to meet the base load requirement of the country in 2032, the required coal & lignite based installed capacity would be 283 GW against the present installed capacity of 217.5 GW. Considering this, Government of India proposes to set up an additional minimum 80 GW coal-based capacity by 2031-32. The estimated capital cost for setting up of new coal based thermal capacity as considered in National Electricity Plan is Rs 8.34 Cr/ MW (at 2021-22 price level). Hence, the thermal capacity addition is expected to entail an expenditure of minimum Rs. 6,67,200 Crs by 2031-32.(i) To reduce the dependency on coal based thermal power plants, Government of India has planned to augment non-fossil fuel based installed electricity generation capacity.

Ministry of Steel Launches ‘Steel Import Monitoring System’ 2.0 Portal,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2037003,"Shri H.D. Kumaraswamy, Union Minister of Steel and Heavy Industries, launched SIMS 2.0, the upgraded Steel Import Monitoring System in the presence of Shri Bhupathiraju Srinivasa Varma, Minister of State for Steel and Heavy Industries, Shri Nagendra Nath Sinha, Secretary, Ministry of Steel, and other senior officials from the Government of India.    SIMS, introduced in 2019, has played a crucial role in providing detailed steel import data to the domestic industry. Based on industry feedback, the Ministry has revamped the portal to develop a more effective SIMS 2.0, a significant step forward in monitoring steel imports and promoting the growth of the domestic steel industry. Availability of such detailed data not only provides input for policy making but also signals areas for production and growth to the domestic steel industry. SIMS 2.0 features API integration with multiple government portals, enhancing quality control and streamlining processes for improved efficiency and effectiveness. The portal boasts a robust data entry system, ensuring consistent and authentic data, which promotes transparency and accountability. Integration of various databases enable stakeholders to locate areas of risk and, thereby, permit better risk management, e.g., if an import consignment declares a particular source of import, which is not licensed by BIS, then Ministry will be enabled to not recommend its import. The detailed data will enable Customs to conduct better analysis and risk management of steel imports.  The development of SIMS 2.0 is a collaborative effort, with contributions from the DGFT, BIS, and MSTC Ltd., a CPSE under the Ministry of Steel. Shri H.D. Kumaraswamy, Union Minister of Steel, emphasized that the launch of SIMS 2.0 is a key achievement, highlighting its inclusion in the Government of India's 100-day agenda. He noted that this milestone represents a crucial step forward in the nation's endeavour to bolster the domestic steel industry and achieve self-sufficiency in steel production, aligning with the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat.  Shri Bhupathiraju Srinivasa Varma, Minister of State for Steel and Heavy Industries, said that this enhanced portal will provide stakeholders with actionable intelligence and data-driven insights, enabling more effective decision-making and strategic planning. Shri Nagendra Nath Sinha, Secretary, Ministry of Steel, pointed out that while India maintains its position as the second-largest steel producer globally, the country's finished steel imports remained significant at around eight million tonnes in 2023-24, underscoring the need for enhanced domestic production capabilities. Accurate monitoring of steel imports is vital to maintaining a healthy trade balance, driving growth, and attracting sustained investment in India's steel industry. He expressed confidence that the upgraded SIMS 2.0 would play a significant role in achieving these objectives.Shri H.D. Kumaraswamy, Union Minister of Steel and Heavy Industries also released the second volume of the book “Safety Guidelines for Iron of Steel Sector” containing the guidelines for 16 different processes being used by the iron & steel sector. It extends the work of the Steel Ministry of publishing 25 safety guidelines in 2020 covering specific risks. Though these guidelines are currently voluntary in nature, the industry has welcomed such guidelines, as these have been generated through a consultation process. Besides addressing safety, these guidelines will have a positive bearing on the productivity. The Minister said “I am happy to release this book and hope that these guidelines will be widely adopted by the iron & steel industry and help the industry to become world class in adopting safety standards and eliminating accidents.”MG/PD/SKShri H.D.

He expressed confidence that the upgraded SIMS 2.0 would play a significant role in achieving these objectives.Shri H.D. Kumaraswamy, Union Minister of Steel and Heavy Industries also released the second volume of the book “Safety Guidelines for Iron of Steel Sector” containing the guidelines for 16 different processes being used by the iron & steel sector. It extends the work of the Steel Ministry of publishing 25 safety guidelines in 2020 covering specific risks. Though these guidelines are currently voluntary in nature, the industry has welcomed such guidelines, as these have been generated through a consultation process. Besides addressing safety, these guidelines will have a positive bearing on the productivity. The Minister said “I am happy to release this book and hope that these guidelines will be widely adopted by the iron & steel industry and help the industry to become world class in adopting safety standards and eliminating accidents.”MG/PD/SK","The Indian government has launched an upgraded version of the Steel Import Monitoring System (SIMS), which provides detailed steel import data to the domestic industry. The new system, called SIMS 2.0, has been developed based on industry feedback and features API integration with multiple government portals, enhancing quality control and streamlining processes for improved efficiency and effectiveness. The detailed data provided by SIMS 2.0 will enable Customs to conduct better analysis and risk management of steel imports, while integration of various databases will allow stakeholders to locate areas of risk and permit better risk management. The development of SIMS 2.0 is a collaborative effort involving the DGFT, BIS, and MSTC Ltd. The launch of SIMS 2.0 is seen as a key achievement in the Indian government's 100-day agenda and is expected to promote the growth of the domestic steel industry and help achieve self-sufficiency in steel production, in line with the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat. Additionally, the Steel Ministry has released a second volume of safety guidelines for the iron and steel sector, which will help address safety concerns and have a positive bearing on productivity. The guidelines are currently voluntary in nature but have been welcomed by the industry, as they have been generated through a consultation process.","President Droupadi Murmu has marked her second year in office by engaging in various initiatives focused on education, cultural heritage, and digital advancements.
