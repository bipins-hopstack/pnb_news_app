NHAI Takes Proactive Steps for Effective Monsoon Management on National Highways,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2030457," In order to address the issue of water logging on National Highways during the monsoon season, NHAI has taken various measures for flood preparedness and provide emergency response on the National Highways across the country. Taking a multi-pronged approach to provide effective solution in both hilly and plain regions, NHAI is working in close coordination with the other executing agencies, local authorities and administration to quickly mobilize machinery and manpower to the flood/land slide affected locations. In addition, to ensure availability of resources for effective disaster preparedness, NHAI is mapping the availability of key machineries for timely deployment.To avoid water logging or flood like situation on National Highways, NHAI along with state irrigation department is undertaking joint inspections to ensure that flow of any running channel/stream is not hindered by a newly constructed highway. Recently, on Delhi-Karta Expressway and other projects, special drive was conducted in consultation with irrigation department.Also, on National Highways passing through urban areas, adequate pumping arrangements will be made on sections wherever there are chances of water logging. Leveraging technology, Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS), along with Rajmaargyatra app shall be used to disseminate information regarding any hindrance on the stretch to National Highway users. In Hilly regions, dedicated Emergency Response Team equipped with sufficient Manpower and Machinery has been mobilized at each landslide prone site in close coordination with District Administration. This will help to immediately clear the muck from the National Highway to enable 24x7 connectivity and provide safe & smooth movement of traffic. Temporary barriers and warning signs have been installed at each landslide prone area to facilitate safe traffic movement. For the implementation of preventive measures, vulnerable locations are identified that are likely to be severely affected like flood / landslide / rock fall prone areas, sinking zones etc. NHAI officials are also inspecting various structures which have a history of flooding to identify damage on abutments/ piers of the bridges. Warning signs will be installed at vulnerable locations to caution road users.   At locations where National Highway may get blocked for traffic movement due to huge landslide, an alternative diversion plan has been chalked out with the District Administration.  Also, Geotechnical Instrumentation including real time monitoring at few vulnerable slopes and tunnels is implemented as pilot.With the advancement of monsoon across India, NHAI has initiated multiple proactive steps to ensure flood preparedness and enable emergency response. These measures will go a long way to provide seamless travel experience to National Highway users during the monsoon season. In order to address the issue of water logging on National Highways during the monsoon season, NHAI has taken various measures for flood preparedness and provide emergency response on the National Highways across the country.

New study connecting rainfall & CO2 increase can aid future conservation of biodiversity hotspots,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2030413,"The unprecedented global increase in greenhouse gases can decrease rainfall in the equatorial region with associated shift and vegetation, and also replace India’s biodiversity hotspots consisting of evergreen forests in the Western Ghats, northeast India and the Andamans into deciduous forests, shows a new study.Deep time hyperthermal events are considered potential analogs for future climate predictions. However, data of these hyperthermal events are mainly known from the mid- and high latitude regions. However, there is lack of quantitative data from the equatorial or tropical regions.Researchers from Birbal Sahni institution of Palaeosciences (BSIP), an autonomous institute of Department of Science and Technology, used fossil pollen and carbon isotope data from the Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM-2), also known as H-1 or Elmo, a period of global warming that occurred around 54 million years ago, to quantify the terrestrial hydrological cycle during that period.It was during this period that the Indian plate lingered near the equator during its journey from the southern to northern hemisphere.  This makes the Indian plate a perfect natural laboratory that offers a peculiar opportunity to understand the vegetation-climate relationship near the equator during the ETM-2. On the basis of availability of fossils from ETM2, the researchers selected the Panandhro Lignite Mine of Kutch in Gujarat and collected fossil pollen from there.Analyzing the pollen, they found that when atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration was more than 1000 ppmv near the palaeo-equator, the rainfall decreased significantly, leading to the expansion of deciduous forests.The study published in the journal Geoscience Frontiers raises important questions about the survival of equatorial/ tropical rainforests and biodiversity hotspots under increased carbon emissions.

Scientists propose a new measure of flexibility for crystals,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2030412,"Researchers have carried out an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms underlying the flexibility of crystals of Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and attributed the flexibility to large structural rearrangements associated with soft and hard vibrations within a crystal that strongly couples to strain fields. The analysis opens doors to innovative materials with diverse applications in various industries.Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a large class of crystalline materials which possess the remarkable ability to absorb gases, such as carbon dioxide, and store them as well as act as filters for crude oil purification. MOFs derive their ability from the presence of nanopores, enhancing their surface areas that, in turn, make them adept at absorbing and storing gases. However, limited stability and mechanical weakness have hindered their broader applications.Addressing this issue, Professor Umesh V. Waghmare from the Theoretical Sciences Unit at Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, (JNCASR) Bengaluru (an autonomous institution under the Department of Science & Technology, Govt. of India) and his team recently introduced a novel quantitative measure of mechanical flexibility for crystals that can be used to screen materials database to identify next-generation flexible materials.Their paper, “Quantifying the intrinsic mechanical flexibility of crystalline materials”, presents groundbreaking insights on the origin of mechanical flexibility and was published in the journal Physical Review B. In particular, the focus of Prof. Waghmare’s research lies with MOFs, which are known for their beautiful crystalline structure and large flexibility.Historically, flexibility in crystals has been assessed in terms of a parameter called elastic modulus, which is a measure of a material’s resistance to strain-induced deformation. In contrast, this study proposes a unique theoretical measure based on the fractional release of elastic stress or strain energy through internal structural rearrangements under symmetry constraints. This new metric can be readily calculated using standard techniques of simulation and can rate the flexibility of a crystal on a scale of zero to one, zero signifying the least flexibility while one indicates maximum flexibility. Additionally, this development provides a unique and quantitative insight into the flexibility of crystals, a dimension that was previously unexplored.Using theoretical calculations, the team examined the flexibility of four different systems with varying elastic stiffness and chemistries. They discovered that flexibility arises from large structural rearrangements associated with soft and hard vibrations within a crystal that strongly couples to strain fields.The team's research thus goes beyond traditional approaches by providing an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms underlying a crystal's flexibility. Unlike previous studies that primarily focused on elastic properties, this work establishes flexibility as an intrinsic property of crystals, independent of their specific shape or form.The newfound measure of flexibility is poised to revolutionize materials science, especially in the context of MOFs. Prof. Waghmare emphasizes, “This theoretical framework enables the screening of thousands of materials in databases, providing a cost-effective and efficient way to identify potential candidates for experimental testing. The design of ultraflexible crystals becomes more achievable, offering a practical solution to the challenges posed by traditional experimental methods.”The collaborative effort underlying this research is particularly noteworthy, with a team of physicists and chemists from Oxford University and the University of California, Santa Barbara involved in the study. This interdisciplinary approach facilitated a more comprehensive understanding of the subject, bridging the gap between theoretical insights and experimental applications.While the proposed measure of flexibility is theoretical, experimentalists will find it very useful. The potential applications of this research extend beyond the realm of physics, opening doors to innovative materials with diverse applications in various industries.Paving the way for a new paradigm in materials research, the study exemplifies the significance of interdisciplinary collaboration and theoretical advancements in shaping the future of materials science.Publication link: https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.108.214106 Contact details:Author Name: Prof. Umesh WaghmareEmail ID: waghmare@jncasr.ac.in  PK/PSMResearchers have carried out an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms underlying the flexibility of crystals of Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and attributed the flexibility to large structural rearrangements associated with soft and hard vibrations within a crystal that strongly couples to strain fields.
