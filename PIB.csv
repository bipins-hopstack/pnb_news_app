Coal Ministry TakesProactive Measures for Disposal and Repurposing of Fly Ash,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2031808,"In a significant move towards environmental protection and resource utilization, the Ministry of Coal (MoC) is actively working to ensure the proper disposal and repurposing of fly ash generated by thermal power plants. By disposing this byproduct of coal-based power generation, the Ministry is leading the charge towards a sustainable future, prioritizing environmental well-being and fostering a circular economy.To minimize the environmental impact of coal combustion, the Ministry of Coal (MoC) promotes the proper disposal of fly ash. Extensive research and development have enabled the effective use of fly ash for filling voids and as a component in construction materials. This not only reduces its environmental footprint but also supports sustainable development practices.The Ministry of Coal has undertaken a significant initiative to ensure the proper disposal of fly ash by allocating mine voids for this purpose.A Central level Working Group (CLWG) under the chairmanship of Additional Secretary, Ministry of Coal was formed in 2023 for the same. The interested Thermal Power Plants (TPPs) applies for the allocation of mine voids to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), which is eventually discussed in the CLWG meeting. In this proactive move, a total of 19 mines have been allocated to 13 TPPs. This allocation addresses environmental concerns associated with fly ash disposal and promotes sustainable practices within the coal mining sector. Additionally, approximately 20.39 lakh tonnes of fly ash have been repurposed to date at Gorbicoal mine pit-1.As per Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change notification dated 3rd November 2009, the term ""fly ash"" means and includes, all ash generated such as Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP) ash, dry fly ash, bottom ash, pond ash and mound ash. Its composition, rich in silicon dioxide (SiO2), calcium oxide (CaO), and aluminum oxide (Al2O3), makes it valuable for various applications, transforming potential waste into useful material. Effective management promotes its use in construction activities, thereby minimizing waste, conserving natural resources, and reducing the carbon footprint.The Ministry of Coal, in collaboration with the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI), is in the process of creating a centralized portal to manage the application process for the allocation of mine voids to Thermal Power Plants (TPPs) for fly ash backfilling activities. This portal aims to streamline operations and ensure transparency and efficiency.Comprehensive feasibility studies are being conducted to explore the optimal methods for mixing fly ash with overburden in operational mines. Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) have been established to guide the safe and efficient use of fly ash, addressing both safety and administrative considerations. A significant feasibility study is underway at the Nigahi operational mine in collaboration with the Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research (CIMFR). This study aims to determine the optimal percentage of fly ash to be mixed with overburden, with results expected soon.Ministry of Coal ensures the safe handling and management of fly ash, mitigating potential environmental concerns associated with the leaching of heavy metals and fine particle emissions and will continue to innovate and implement sustainable practices, ensuring a cleaner and greener future for India.Fostering collaboration with power plants, industries, and regulatory bodies, Coal Ministry aims to achieve optimal fly ash management.

Indian scientists develop open-source tool to generate infrared star catalogue for Thirty Meter Telescope,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2031841,"A new online tool to create a comprehensive star catalogue for the Adaptive Optics (AO) system of the upcoming Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), can enable this ground-based telescope-- one of the largest to be operational in the next decade, generate sharper astronomical images.The Thirty Meter Telescope, the Giant Magellan Telescope, and the European Southern Observatory’s Extremely Large Telescope represent the future of ground-based astronomy. India is a key partner in the TMT project, with India TMT Center at Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) leading the national collaboration.Telescopes on the surface of the Earth face the challenge of atmospheric distortion, affecting the quality of captured images. This is particularly crucial for telescopes with high light-collection capacities, like the TMT, which are sensitive to upper atmospheric disturbances. To counteract these distortions, the TMT will use an Adaptive Optics System (AOS) that continuously senses and adjusts for atmospheric changes to produce high-quality images. In order to do this, an all-sky catalogue of NIR stars is an essential requirement. “The AOS system on TMT, known as the Narrow Field Infrared Adaptive Optics System (NFIRAOS), will be enhanced by a Laser Guide Star (LGS) facility,” explained Dr. Sarang Shah from IIA. “This facility will project up to nine lasers into the sky to create artificial guide stars. However, atmospheric turbulence affects these laser beams, so measuring atmospheric tip-tilt is uncertain. To correct these effects, the AO system requires feedback from three real stars, known as Natural Guide Stars (NGS).”
For optimal performance, simulations indicate that NFIRAOS requires at least three NGS within its field of view, each as bright as 22 magnitudes in the near-infrared J waveband. Currently, no such comprehensive catalogue of stars exists which will provide NGS in all-regions of the sky. For optimal performance, simulations indicate that NFIRAOS requires at least three NGS within its field of view, each as bright as 22 magnitudes in the near-infrared J waveband. To ensure these requirements are met across all regions of the sky, a comprehensive catalogue of NIR stars is essential. Currently, no such catalogue exists that can reliably provide NGS for all sky regions, highlighting the critical need for the new tool developed by Indian researchers to create this all-sky NIR star catalogue.Researchers at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) in Bengaluru and their collaborators have developed an automated code that can be used as an online tool to create a catalogue of Near Infrared (NIR) stars. “The automated code can compute the expected near-infrared magnitudes of stellar sources identified in various optical sky surveys using their optical magnitudes,” noted Dr. Smitha Subramanian, co-author and faculty at IIA. Using multi-band optical photometry from the PAN-STARRS telescope, the researchers filtered and identified stars, predicting their near infrared magnitudes through innovative methods. They validated their approach using data from the UKIDSS survey of the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, achieving over 85% accuracy in their NIR magnitude predictions.“Our method shows great promise in generating the all-sky catalogue of NIR stars needed before TMT’s first run in the next decade,” added Dr. Sarang Shah the lead researcher.India’s participation in the TMT collaboration involves three institutes: the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bengaluru, the Inter-University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, and the Aryabhatta Research Institute for Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital.

The TMT, along with the Giant Magellan Telescope and the European Southern Observatory’s Extremely Large Telescope, represents the future of ground-based astronomy. The TMT will use an Adaptive Optics System (AOS) to counteract atmospheric distortions, which requires feedback from three real stars known as Natural Guide Stars (NGS). However, currently, no such comprehensive catalogue of stars exists that can provide NGS in all-regions of the sky. The Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) and collaborators have developed an automated code that can predict the near-infrared magnitudes of stellar sources identified in various optical sky surveys using their optical magnitudes. The tool has achieved over 85% accuracy in its NIR magnitude predictions using data from the UKIDSS survey of the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope. The detailed findings of this research have been published in the Astronomical Journal.","The President of India praised NISER's quick rise in education and commended its integration of scientific rationality and traditional values.
