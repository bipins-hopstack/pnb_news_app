"Reducing Coal Imports, Boosting Exports",https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2038365,"The Ministry of Coal spearheading a transformative initiative to reduce coal imports and promote coal exports, is marking a significant shift in the country's energy landscape. This strategic move aims to enhance domestic coal production, strengthen energy security, and support the growth of the coal sector.India's coal production witnessed a remarkable increase of 11.65% in the year 2023-24, demonstrating the government's commitment to self-reliance. The target for the year 2024-25 has been set at an ambitious 1,080Million Tonnes, further solidifying India's position as a major coal producer.To streamline the process of reducing coal imports, an Inter-Ministerial Committee was formed and the committee will facilitate discussions and coordinate efforts among various ministries to identify opportunities for import substitution. While acknowledging the need for some high-grade coal imports, the focus remains on minimizing non-essential imports and promoting the use of domestically produced coal.In addition to reducing imports, the government is actively promoting coal exports to capitalize on the growing global demand for the fossil fuel. This initiative aims to position India as a key player in the international coal market, generating revenue and creating employment opportunities in the sector.The reduction in coal imports and the promotion of exports are crucial steps in ensuring India's energy security. By relying more on domestically produced coal, the country can reduce its dependence on foreign sources and insulate itself from global price fluctuations.The transformation of the coal sector is expected to have a positive impact on the Indian economy. The increased production and export of coal will contribute to economic growth, create jobs, and generate revenue for the government. Additionally, the reduced reliance on imports will help conserve foreign exchange reserves.According to a study conducted by IIM Ahmedabad, there may exist potential of exporting 15 MT to the following neighboring countries:The Maitree Super Thermal Power Project (MSTPP)(2X660 MW) constructed by Bangladesh India Friendship Power Company Ltd (BIFPCL) is a 50:50 JV between NTPC & Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) requires 5 Million Tons coal per annum as per the international pricing policyMinistry of Coal’s initiatives to reduce coal imports and promote coal exports mark a significant milestone in the country's energy transition.

The initiative aims to prevent windfall gains to intermediaries and ensure reasonable profit margins at the retail level, benefiting consumers and promoting fair trade practices. NCCF's commitment to protecting consumer interests and promoting a stable market ecosystem is demonstrated through this intervention. The number of retail locations may be increased in the future to provide greater convenience for consumers."

PROVIDING PUCCA HOUSES TO ALL IN URBAN AREAS,https://pib.gov.in//PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2038342,"‘Land’ and ‘Colonization’ are State subjects. Therefore, schemes related to housing for their citizens are implemented by States/Union Territories (UTs). However, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs supplements the efforts of States/UTs by providing Central assistance under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana- Urban (PMAY-U) since 25.06.2015 to provide pucca houses with basic civic amenities to all eligible urban beneficiaries across the country. The scheme has four verticals namely, Beneficiary-led individual house construction/enhancements (BLC), Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP), “In-Situ” Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) and Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS).PMAY-U is a demand driven scheme and Government of India has not fixed any target for construction of houses. Based on the demand for housing in the urban areas, States/UTs prepare project proposals and after approval of State Level Sanctioning & Monitoring Committee (SLSMC), these are submitted to this Ministry for sanctioning of admissible Central assistance by Central Sanctioning & Monitoring Committee (CSMC). Government of India is providing its fixed share as Central assistance of ₹1.0 lakh per house under ISSR, ₹1.5 lakh per house for AHP and BLC verticals of PMAY-U. Under CLSS vertical of PMAY-U, an interest subsidy at the rate of 6.5% which amounts upto ₹2.67 lakh per house was provided for beneficiaries of Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) and Lower Income Group (LIG) category. The remaining cost of the house as per Detailed Project Report (DPR) is shared by States/UTs/Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)/Beneficiaries. Central assistance under PMAY-U is released to States/UTs in three installments of 40%, 40% and 20%. The release of Central assistance is incumbent upon fulfillment of mandatory compliances by the concerned States/UTs as per operational guidelines and other instructions issued by Ministry of Finance. Due installment of Central assistance is released as soon as requisite compliances are achieved in sanctioned projects.Based on the proposals submitted by States/UTs, a total of 118.64 lakh houses have been sanctioned under PMAY-U by the Ministry as on 15.07.2024. Of the sanctioned houses, 114.33 lakh have been grounded for construction; of which 85.04 lakh have been completed/delivered. State/UT-wise details of number of houses sanctioned, grounded, completed/delivered along with Central assistance sanctioned and released under PMAY-U is given at Annexure. The timeline for completion of projects varies from State to State and generally it takes 12-36 months in different verticals of the scheme and as per DPRs of respective projects. The completion timeline for houses depends on various factors like availability of encumbrance free land, statutory compliances for start of construction, arrangement of funds by beneficiaries etc. States/UTs have been advised to expedite the construction of sanctioned houses so that all houses are completed within the stipulated timeline. The scheme period, which was earlier upto 31.03.2022, has been extended upto 31.12.2024, except for Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) vertical, to complete all the houses sanctioned without changing the funding pattern and implementation methodology.
